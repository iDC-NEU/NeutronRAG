The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game.

Before going 7-6 in 2021, Oregon State had seven consecutive losing seasons. Now the Beavers are 17-9 over the past two seasons. And with Clemson transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei joining the program next season, the Beavers could be a trendy preseason pick to contend for the Pac-12 title. Florida State: The Seminoles have 10 wins in a season for the first time since 2016 after a 35-32 win over Oklahoma in the Cheez-It Bowl. Jordan Travis threw for 418 yards on 38 attempts while Johnny Wilson had eight catches for 202 yards. The Seminoles had 587 yards on 72 plays and won the game despite going 0-of-3 on fourth down attempts. It’s the first bowl win for Florida State since 2017 and a huge boost for a program that will enter 2023 as the top challenger to Clemson in the ACC. Pitt QB Nick Patti: Nick Patti has been a backup at Pitt for the past five seasons but got a chance to start in the Sun Bowl vs. UCLA. He made it count. In just his third career start, Patti led the Panthers to an epic comeback win.",

            "negative6": "The Aggies opened the season 1-5 before closing out the year by winning six of seven to finish 7-6. NMSU won a combined eight games in its previous four seasons, so Kill has executed an incredible turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern Miss RB Frank Gore Jr.: Frank Gore Jr. ran wild in Southern Miss’ win over Rice in the LendingTree Bowl. Gore set an all-time bowl record with 329 yards on just 21 carries in the 38-24 win. Gore rushed for two touchdowns and also had an 18-yard touchdown catch. The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this team’s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next season. Eastern Michigan: With a win over San Jose State in the Potato Bowl, EMU notched its first bowl victory since 1987.",
            "negative7": "Western Kentucky: WKU may have had the most impressive performance of bowl season. The Hilltoppers trounced South Alabama 44-23 in the New Orleans Bowl in a game that was not as close as the final score may indicate. South Alabama was looking for its first-ever bowl win, but WKU jumped out to a 31-3 halftime lead and never looked back, putting up a total of 677 yards by the time the final seconds ticked off. Austin Reed threw for 497 yards and four touchdowns in the win. Air Force: Air Force looked right at home on an incredibly cold night in Fort Worth. The Falcons ran all over Baylor in a 30-15 victory in the Armed Forces Bowl. Air Force rushed for 276 yards and limited Baylor to just 42 rushing yards. With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons. In the shortened 2020 season, the Falcons finished 3-3. As a program, Air Force has won four consecutive bowl games. New Mexico State: Year 1 of the Jerry Kill era at New Mexico State ended with a bowl victory. NMSU knocked off Bowling Green 24-19 in the Quick Lane Bowl on Monday to capture the program’s second bowl victory since 1960.",
            "negative8": "The game was a punt hater’s dream. And it was a nightmare for Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart. He threw three interceptions and fumbled once. Texas Tech QB Tyler Shough rushed for two TDs and threw for another as the Red Raiders easily held on to a 19-point halftime lead throughout the second half. The loss also meant that Ole Miss ends the season at 8-5 after starting the season 7-0. Oklahoma: The Sooners entered the Cheez-It Bowl shorthanded and as significant underdogs to Florida State. Losing 35-32 was still a cover for Oklahoma. But the loss also means that Oklahoma finishes the season at 6-7. That’s the first losing season for OU since 1998. The first year of the Brent Venables era was a bit rocky — especially when you consider the success that Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley had at USC. But there’s no reason to panic in Norman. Yet. SMU: The Mustangs entered the New Mexico Bowl as 4.5-point favorites over a BYU team that started freshman third-string QB Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters for the first time. Yet BYU did just enough on the ground to eke out a 24-23 win after stopping an SMU two-point conversion with eight seconds left.",
            "negative9": "Head coach Kirk Ferentz has kept things close to the vest with his signal-callers, but it's looking like Petras, who started the season as the starter and ended the season as the starter, will get the nod. Star running back Tyler Goodson opted out of the Citrus Bowl for the Hawkeyes as he prepares for the NFL Draft. Freshman receiver Keagan Johnson has also been ruled out for the Citrus Bowl.",
            "negative10": "Georgia Southern: The Camellia Bowl was a painful watch if you were an Eagles fan. Buffalo beat Georgia Southern 23-21 after going 12-of-19 on third down while averaging less than three yards a carry. In addition to being unable to consistently stop Buffalo on third down, Georgia Southern players dropped multiple catchable passes. Kyle Vantrease threw for 352 yards on 45 attempts and hit Joshua Thompson on a 79-yard TD. But Georgia Southern never got the ball back after pulling within two with 3:38 to go because of two crucial third down conversions by the Bulls to run out the clock. Oklahoma State: The Cowboys entered the Guaranteed Rate Bowl as underdogs to Wisconsin, so OSU’s 24-17 loss to the Badgers wasn’t terribly surprising. But it’s still worth noting just how poorly OSU finished the season. The Cowboys started the season 6-1 and finished 7-6 after ending the season on a 1-5 run. Yeah, Oklahoma State played the final two games of the season without QB Spencer Sanders, but the biggest culprit for the collapse was the regression of the defense in 2022. A testy Mike Gundy didn’t want to talk about any potential staff changes after the game and we’re not going to be surprised if there are some staff announcements forthcoming from OSU in the near future.",
            "negative11": "Iowa QBs combined to throw for seven TDs all season while the defense itself scored six touchdowns. UCLA: UCLA had a meltdown in the Sun Bowl, blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to Pitt. The Bruins led 28-14 midway through the third quarter but allowed Pitt to come back and win 37-35 with a field goal in the final seconds. In his final college game, Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw three costly interceptions. Two came deep in Pitt territory and the third came deep in his own territory, giving the Panthers a short field to tie the game at 28-28 early in the fourth. To make matters worse, UCLA fumbled the ensuing kickoff to allow Pitt to take the lead. Later in the fourth, UCLA scored with 34 seconds to go to take a 35-34 lead. It looked like it would be the game-winner, but the defense allowed Pitt to go 46 yards in 30 seconds and kick the game-winning field goal. Brutal. UCLA has not won a bowl game since the 2014 season. Ole Miss: The Rebels had 11 drives that didn’t end in points in a 42-25 loss to Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl. Ole Miss turned the ball over five times, gave up the ball five times on downs and punted once. While the Rebels were just 2-of-7 on fourth downs, Texas Tech was 5-of-6.",
            "negative12": "Gavin Williams, LeShon Williams and Arland Bruce IV have taken the five total rushes and Spencer Petras is 3-for-5 for 18 yards so far. Nothing hideous. But nothing effective, either. Well, that was not very difficult. After Iowa's empty possession to start the day, Kentucky responded with a methodical 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that ate up 7:28 of clock. Quarterback Will Levis capped it with a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The Wildcats converted on two third downs — a third-and-3 at their 42 (they got a 5-yard run) and a third-and-4 at Iowa's 29 (they got a 14-yard completion). Nothing doing on the Hawkeyes' first possession. Spencer Petras started with a 12-yard completion to Sam LaPorta on the game's first play, but Iowa went three-and-out from there. Kentucky will take over at its 20 after Tory Taylor's punt went into the end zone. Spencer Petras was on the field for the first snap. Start question, answered. Looking for some pregame reading? Here's Register columnist Chad Leistikow with his prediction for the Citrus Bowl. There was a lot of talk about whether it'd be Spencer Petras or Alex Padilla behind center for the Hawkeyes today.",
            "negative13": "The freshman Maiava-Peters threw for just 47 yards and an interception but rushed 14 times for 96 yards while Christopher Brooks rushed 19 times for 88 yards. SMU didn’t have receiver Rashee Rice but still had just 218 yards passing on 37 pass attempts. UTSA: The Roadrunners are still searching for their first bowl win after losing 18-12 to Troy in the Cure Bowl. It was an absolutely ugly performance from UTSA too. Without offensive coordinator Will Stein (now the OC at Oregon), the proficient UTSA offense committed five turnovers. The Roadrunners also had nine penalties for 104 yards and many of those penalties came at critical times. A win over the Trojans would have been a big boost to a UTSA team making a step up to the AAC in 2023. NC State: Dave Doeren's risk-averse decision-making may have cost his team a bowl win. NC State lost the Duke's Mayo Bowl 16-12. In the loss, Doeren decided to kick field goals twice inside the Maryland 10-yard line. In the first half, Doeren kicked on fourth-and-goal from the 2. And when his team trailed 13-9 midway through the fourth, Doeren sent his kicker out instead of going for it on fourth-and-3 from the 9.",
            "negative14": "It’s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987 California Bowl was the program’s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished 9-4 for the season. That’s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.",
            "negative15": "The NC State offense struggled mightily all day, and that ended up being the final scoring opportunity of the game for NC State. San Diego State: The Aztecs turned the ball over five times in a 25-23 loss to Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl. The Blue Raiders had just 170 yards in the win and threw for 236 yards. Yes, you read that correctly. Thanks to sacks, MTSU had a remarkable -66 rushing yards on 30 attempts. And still won the game. SDSU QB Jalen Mayden threw three interceptions and also had a fumble. The Aztecs’ final turnover came with 55 seconds to go on a 4th and 24 when Tyrell Shavers fumbled the ball after a 12-yard gain. Cincinnati: It was a listless performance for the Bearcats in a 24-7 loss to Louisville in the Fenway Bowl. Cincinnati had just 127 yards of total offense and allowed 419 yards to the Cardinals. Cincy got just 10 first downs and rushed for 44 yards on 38 attempts after sacks were factored in. Louisville even turned the ball over four times to Cincinnati’s two and the game still wasn’t close. If you didn’t know any better, you would have assumed that Scott Satterfield had gone to a far worse team when he left Louisville for Cincy before the bowl game.",
            "negative16": "He threw for 224 yards and ran for 73 more, including a gutsy 11-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal. UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game. This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons. In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for 209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine wins in 2022.",
            "negative17": "Duke capped off a remarkable season by beating UCF 30-13 on Wednesday in the Military Bowl — the program’s first bowl win since 2018. With the win, Duke got to nine wins for the first time since 2014. Mike Elko has done one of the best coaching jobs in the country in his first season with the Blue Devils. The program was barely competitive in David Cutcliffe’s final seasons on the job, going a combined 5-18 (1-17 ACC) in his final two years. With Wednesday’s win, Duke finished the season 9-4 overall with a 5-3 mark in ACC play. It was just the third season in school history that the Blue Devils had finished with a winning conference record and won a bowl game. Washington: After going 4-8 in 2021, Washington capped off a tremendous turnaround by beating Texas 27-20 in the Alamo Bowl. With the win, Washington finished the season with 11 wins — the most it has had in a season since 2016. That's the year the Huskies reached the College Football Playoff. After coming over from Fresno State, head coach Kalen DeBoer was able to revitalize the program in just one season. The addition of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played a big role. Penix, who will return next season, threw for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the bowl win.",

            "negative19": "After a disastrous first play that saw Kentucky log a 10-yard run and get an extra 10 yards to Iowa's 11, the Hawkeye defense shored up and forced the Wildcats to settle for another field goal after they intercepted Patras at the 31. Spencer Petras' second-and-11 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted, and Kentucky will take over at Iowa's 31-yard line. Oh dear ... that was painful for Hawkeye fans. Zach VanValkenburg and Joe Evans secured back-to-back sacks to force Kentucky into a third-and-26 from its 46-yard line. Then ... Will Levis connected with Wan'Dale Robinson for a 34-yard completion down the middle, right in the hole of Iowa's defense. The Hawkeyes were able to force the Wildcats into a 21-yard field goal, so that was a win. But still, not getting off the field on a third-and-24 is rough. It was another long, methodical drive — 14 plays, 72 yards, 8:15 of time. My goodness, it's hot down there. On-field temperatures are well above 100 degrees in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium for the Citrus Bowl. Not quite the 10-degree winter weather we're getting here in Iowa, eh? Iowa's offense showed some good things on a scoring drive that led to a 28-yard field goal from Caleb Shudak.",
            "negative20": "The the offense responded with its best drive of the day, featuring a gorgeous 34-yard completion from Spencer Petras to Sam LaPorta and 27 hard-earned yards from Gavin Williams on three carries. But on a fourth-and-inches at Kentucky's 11, the Hawkeyes were aggressive and wanted the touchdown ... but Petras and Tyler Linderbaum couldn't connect on the snap and Petras fell on the ball behind the line of scrimmage. Seven plays, 69 yards ... no points. This stat from Register columnist Chad Leistikow is damning. The Hawkeyes were able to gain a few chunks of yards, to get close enough for a last-second Hail Mary from Spencer Petras. It was intercepted. To halftime we go, and the Wildcats start the second half with the ball. Petras went 10-for-16 for 82 yards and two interceptions. Gavin Williams led the backfield with five carries for 25 yards. This half has been pretty much all Kentucky, with the Wildcats out-possessing Iowa 19:22 to 10:38. They're also 4-for-7 on third-down attempts, while Iowa is 0-for-4. Another save from the Hawkeye defense.",
            "negative21": "A hard play-action on second down, then a little screen to Sam LaPorta running behind Mason Richman and Tyler Linderbaum as lead blockers. It worked to perfection for a 36-yard touchdown pass. What a drive — nine plays, 92 yards, 3:15 of clock. Iowa has looked like an entirely different team in this second half. Big plays from Jack Campbell spearheaded Iowa's defensive effort to stall Kentucky near midfield, and now the Hawkeyes take over at their 8-yard line, down 13-10. And Gavin Williams starts the drive with a 19-yard run. Can you say momentum swing? We've got ourselves a game, folks. Good things usually happen when Arland Bruce IV, who was an All-Iowa Elite Team running back in his senior season at Ankeny, gets the ball in the backfield. The true freshman capped a six-play, 50-yard drive with a 20-yard rushing score on a jet sweep, a play that's traditionally been kind to the Hawkeyes. LeShon Williams also logged two carries for 20 yards on that drive. Iowa already has 119 total yards in the second half, which nearly matches their whole first-half total. Iowa's defense came out of the half well and forced a Kentucky punt.",

As a result, at the league's owners meetings in Chicago on May 23, 2017, the league re-awarded Super Bowl LV to the lone remaining candidate, Tampa Bay, and awarded Super Bowl LVI to Los Angeles.[21]  The official logo for the game was unveiled on February 9, 2021, maintaining the standard design used since Super Bowl LI, but introducing sunset-themed[22] designs reflecting the landscape of the host city/nearby area (featuring in this case palm trees) within the traditional Roman numerals.[23]  In early January 2022, it was reported that AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, was being considered as an alternate site for the game as a contingency plan due to an increase of COVID-19 infections in California attributed to the Omicron variant.

Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[51] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H.

In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games.",

Seven Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was using at the time, a situation that has not arisen after Super Bowl XXVII's host stadium was selected on March 19, 1991. This was as the winning market was previously not required to host the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team used, if the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing NFL home stadium in the same city; for example, Los Angeles's last five Super Bowls were all played at the Rose Bowl, which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl.",

New Orleans, the site of Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, invested more than $1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading up to the game.[61]  The NFL allocates backup stadiums for the Super Bowl every year, in the event of a last-minute relocation of the game.[62]  The designated \"home team\" alternates between the NFC team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games.[63][64] This alternation was initiated with the first Super Bowl, when the Packers were the designated home team.",

Such a swap out of the normal rotation was done before when CBS was given Super Bowl XXVI in January 1992 after it acquired the rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics (which started 13 days later), and NBC then aired Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII in the next two consecutive years.

One year later, the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs defeated the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 23–7 in Super Bowl IV in New Orleans, which was the final AFL–NFL World Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three NFL teams (the Baltimore Colts, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Cleveland Browns) would constitute the American Football Conference (AFC), while the remaining NFL clubs would form the National Football Conference (NFC).

To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games.",

The Louisiana Superdome has hosted seven Super Bowls, the most of any venue, with an eighth Super Bowl scheduled to take place in the 2024–25 season. The Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowls II and III.  Seven Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was using at the time, a situation that has not arisen after Super Bowl XXVII's host stadium was selected on March 19, 1991. This was as the winning market was previously not required to host the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team used, if the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing NFL home stadium in the same city; for example, Los Angeles's last five Super Bowls were all played at the Rose Bowl, which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl.",

New Orleans, the site of Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, invested more than $1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading up to the game.[61]  The NFL allocates backup stadiums for the Super Bowl every year, in the event of a last-minute relocation of the game.[62]  The designated \"home team\" alternates between the NFC team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games.[63][64] This alternation was initiated with the first Super Bowl, when the Packers were the designated home team.",

Such a swap out of the normal rotation was done before when CBS was given Super Bowl XXVI in January 1992 after it acquired the rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics (which started 13 days later), and NBC then aired Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII in the next two consecutive years. NBC also aired Super Bowl LII in February 2018, under the normal Super Bowl cycle, a few days before it began its coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics. In all the other previous Winter Olympics years, the league stuck to the normal broadcast cycle regardless of which network was broadcasting the Olympics. However, Super Bowl LVI was the first Super Bowl to actually occur when the Winter Olympics were already underway: primetime coverage of the Olympics would have had to compete with the Super Bowl—diluting viewership and advertising revenue for CBS and NBC,[117][118] and there is an unsaid gentleman's agreement between the NFL's broadcasters to not air competing original programming against the Super Bowl.",

This practice ended at Super Bowl XLV, which returned to using current pop acts such as The Black Eyed Peas, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga.[46][47]  Excluding Super Bowl XXXIX, the famous \"I'm going to Disney World!\" advertising campaign took place in every Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXI, when quarterback Phil Simms from the Giants became the first player to say the tagline.

After the NFL's Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, some team owners feared for the future of the merger.

One year later, the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs defeated the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 23–7 in Super Bowl IV in New Orleans, which was the final AFL–NFL World Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three NFL teams (the Baltimore Colts, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Cleveland Browns) would constitute the American Football Conference (AFC), while the remaining NFL clubs would form the National Football Conference (NFC).

Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 was originally awarded to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, but after Arizona voters elected not to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a paid state employees' holiday in 1990, the NFL moved the game to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.[54] When voters in Arizona opted to create such a legal holiday in 1992, Super Bowl XXX in 1996 was awarded to Tempe.

Campion became the third woman to win in this category at Golden Globes. Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy: “Hacks” HBO Max’s “Hacks” won the main Television (Musical or Comedy) category and Best Actress — Comedy/Musical for star Jean Smart at the 79th Golden Globes Awards. While other shows in this category were also strong contenders, such as Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso,” “Hacks” proved to be a favorite in this category with its first season. “Hacks can laugh all the way to the bank with this one,” announced the official Golden Globes account via Twitter. “Congratulations on taking home the #GoldenGlobe for Best Musical/Comedy Series.” Best Television Series — Drama: “Succession” HBO’s “Succession” was the big winner at this year’s Golden Globes, scooping three major categories.",
            "evidences2": "Concerns about the lack of diversity in the HFPA board and the award nominees were brought up last year, and similar concerns were still brought up this year. Similar to NBC’s stance, many actors were absent in a statement to demand change. Winning actors including Will Smith, Nicole Kidman, Andrew Garfield and Rachel Zegler were not present to receive their awards. While the HFPA has announced new policies for diversity, equity and inclusion, and inducted 21 new members, including several people of color as well as the addition of Neil Phillips as chief diversity officer, the future of the Golden Globes still remains uncertain. Despite the controversy, though, many films and television shows have much to celebrate as their casts and crews were recognized for their hard work.  Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy: “West Side Story” After receiving 4 nominations, Steven Spielberg’s 2021 adaptation of the 1957 musical dominated the Comedy/Musical category at the 79th Golden Globe Awards. “West Side Story,” won the 79th Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture — Musical/Comedy and Best Supporting Actress Role — Motion Picture (Ariana DeBose). The film scored two additional wins via Rachel Zegler, who made her film debut as the female lead, Maria Vasquez, and Arianna Debose, who played Anita."

Such a swap out of the normal rotation was done before when CBS was given Super Bowl XXVI in January 1992 after it acquired the rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics (which started 13 days later), and NBC then aired Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII in the next two consecutive years.

Taylor served on the Rams coaching staff under McVay from 2017 to 2018 and was hired as Cincinnati's head coach after Super Bowl LIII.[103] Whitworth, at age 40, was the first player in a Super Bowl to be older than both head coaches.[104]  This was the first Super Bowl in which both starting quarterbacks held career losing records.[105] It was also the second in which both were first overall selections in the NFL Draft, along with Super Bowl 50. Burrow reached the Super Bowl faster than any previous quarterback taken first overall by doing so in his second season.[106]  Country singer Mickey Guyton performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", making her the first black female country singer to perform the national anthem at the game.

This finish granted the Bengals the first overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft, which they used to select Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Joe Burrow.[59][60] Burrow posted strong numbers as a rookie, but won only two games before his season was cut short by a knee injury. In the following year's draft, Cincinnati used the fifth overall pick on wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, who was Burrow's teammate at LSU.[61][62] The team also drafted placekicker Evan McPherson in the fifth round.[63] On defense, the Bengals signed free agent defensive end Trey Hendrickson, who was coming off a breakout season with the New Orleans Saints.[64] Defensive tackles Larry Ogunjobi and B.

By Cora Engelbrecht, Euan Ward and Oliver Whang The 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists whose work harnessed the power of molecular interaction and introduced new, unobtrusive ways of studying the natural world. Carolyn R. Bertozzi of Stanford University, Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen and K. Barry Sharpless of Scripps Research will share the prize, which honors the scientists’ independent research that resulted in the development of what is known as click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. The three researchers will also split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, around $900,000. Their works have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In winning the award on Wednesday, Dr. Sharpless became only the fifth person to win two Nobels, having received the chemistry prize in 2001 for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions.

The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded “for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities, and pioneering quantum information science,” the academy said. The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation.

Biology was in its infancy in Nobel's day and no award was established. The Economist argued there is no Nobel Prize for mathematics either, another major discipline, and added that Nobel's stipulation of no more than three winners is not readily applicable to modern physics, where progress is typically made through huge collaborations rather than by individuals alone.[27]  In 2020, Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prizes for science awarded between 1995–2017 were clustered in just a few disciplines within their broader fields. Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period.[28]  ^ A.

One such application is in “drug delivery,” which involves “doing chemistry inside living patients to make sure drugs go to the right place and not to the wrong place.” But all those plans for the future came after her surprise, which registered when she first called into the committee. “I’m absolutely stunned. I’m sitting here and can hardly breathe,” she said. “I’m still not entirely positive that it’s real — but it’s getting realer by the minute.” The prize was awarded to Benjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan for their development of a tool that spurred research into new drugs and reduced chemistry’s effect on the environment.",
            "negative15": "Bertozzi also became the eighth woman to be awarded the chemistry prize, the latest since Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna in 2020. Molecules are reacting all around us, constantly, in our drinks, on the tips of our fingers, in our phones. These reactions create new molecules, break down old ones, allow energy swaps — they shape the variegated dynamics of the universe. For scientists looking to understand these forces, combining molecules in a controlled way can be difficult, especially in a delicate environment like a living cell, because everything is so closely connected. Often the surrounding molecules are disturbed in the process, changing the very thing a researcher wants to study. In 2001, Dr. Sharpless and some of his colleagues published a paper introducing something he called click chemistry, a new way of approaching this kind of molecular control when applied to the creation of new drug compounds. The method would be based around one rule, he wrote: “All searches must be restricted to molecules that are easy to make.” Instead of trying to synthesize, or chemically create, molecules by forcing a difficult organic bond, Dr. Sharpless, said, focus instead on bonds that form fast and produce stable byproducts. If done in the right way, the tougher bonds will form automatically, clicking into place. Think of them “as gifts of nature,” Dr. Sharpless wrote.",
            "negative16": "citation needed]  The Nobel Laureates in chemistry are selected by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In its first stage, several thousand people are asked to nominate candidates. These names are scrutinized and discussed by experts until only the laureates remain. This slow and thorough process, is arguably what gives the prize its importance.  Forms, which amount to a personal and exclusive invitation, are sent to about three thousand selected individuals to invite them to submit nominations. The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the Prize. Nomination records are sealed for fifty years. In practice, some nominees do become known. It is also common for publicists to make such a claim – founded or not.  The nominations are screened by committee, and a list is produced of approximately two hundred preliminary candidates. This list is forwarded to selected experts in the field. They remove all but approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations to the appropriate institution.  While posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can occur if the individual died in the months between the nomination and the decision of the prize committee.  The award in chemistry requires the significance of achievements being recognized is \"tested by time\". In practice it means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer.",

            "negative20": "“What’s unique about click chemistry is that the two reagents, in the presence of hundreds of thousands of different types of molecules, they will only seek out each other and only give one product,” said Jiong Yang, a program director at the National Institute of General Medical Science who oversees Dr. Sharpless’s work. “That’s the basis of all this technical development.” This shift in approach was soon followed by the discovery of a reaction called copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, which put the theory into practice. Azides and alkynes are two types of molecules, and Dr. Meldal and Dr. Sharpless independently found that when they were combined, using copper as a catalyst, the reaction was fast and efficient and the product was stable. Now known as the “crown jewel of click chemistry,” the discovery was “like opening the floodgates,” said Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry in a briefing after the laureates were announced. “We were using it everywhere, to build everything.” Molecules could now be combined quickly, efficiently and without much fuss, and the applications immediately extended “beyond chemists,” said Angela Wilson, the president of the American Chemical Society. Material science, pharmaceutical development, tissue regeneration, brightening agents — “this just opens up a world of possibilities in terms of materials and polymers,” Dr. Wilson said.",

By pioneering a method for mapping biomolecules on the surface of cells, Bertozzi helped create a suite of techniques comprising “bioorthogonal chemistry,” a term Bertozzi coined, which means “not interacting with biology.” The method describes chemical reactions that allow scientists to explore cells and track biological processes without disrupting the normal chemistry of the cell. Bertozzi at the Molecular Foundry in 2006. (credit: Roy Kaltschmidt/Berkeley Lab) Bertozzi’s lab first developed the method in the late 1990s and early 2000s. During that time, she was one of the six scientists who helped establish the Molecular Foundry, a nanoscience research facility that provides scientists from around the world access to cutting-edge expertise and instrumentation. She served as the Molecular Foundry’s director when the facility first opened its doors to the research community in 2006, and she founded the Foundry’s Biological Nanostructures Facility, where scientists study the synthesis, analysis and mimicry of biological nanostructures. “Carolyn Bertozzi’s impact on nanoscience is huge,” said Jeff Neaton, associate laboratory director of Berkeley Lab’s Energy Sciences Area.",
            "negative22": "Their buckles easily snapped together and wouldn’t link onto anything they shouldn’t. Then, in 2003, Carolyn Bertozzi proposed that click chemistry could be used in studies of biological systems to make it easier to observe vital cellular processes without interfering with them. Bertozzi called this “bioorthogonal” chemistry in a paper she and her colleagues published that year. The term has since been widely-adopted term in the field. The ability to perform complex reactions in living systems without interfering with natural biological reactions made it possible to study molecules and cellular processes in cells and inside complex organisms such as zebra fish, rather than in laboratory dishes. It has already helped scientists understand an important protein processing reaction called glycosylation, helped to develop molecular imaging molecules that could detect disease in living organisms, and opened up the possibility of selectively delivering drugs to particular tissues in the body. These findings have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together and how to do it in living cells,” Åqvist said. Today’s announcement marks the second time that Sharpless has won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Explaining the concept of quantum teleportation, he said that it uses the features of entanglement which can be used to transport information, carried by the object, to another place where the object is then reconstituted. This can be done without knowing the information, because to know the information would violate Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle which states that the position and the momentum of an object cannot both be measured exactly, at the same time, even in theory. “So far this can be done on very small particles.  It is fundamentally important for transferring information between quantum computer,” he said.

            "negative32": "It could hardly be more apt that the law of physics that Wu toppled was called the principle of parity. Like a prism, the 1957 Nobel Prize separated out elements of identity like bands of light, rendering the impact of gender more visible. The following year Columbia finally promoted Wu to the rank of full professor. In his Nobel lecture that December, Yang told the committee and guests how crucial Wu's experiment had been, making a bold statement that the results were due to Wu's team's courage and skill. Lee would later plead with the Nobel Committee to recognize Wu's work. Oppenheimer publicly stated that Wu should have shared in the 1957 prize. Segrè called the overthrow of parity “probably the major development of physics after the war.” Other scientists criticized Wu's exclusion from the highest recognition of scientific achievement, too. In 1991 Douglas Hofstadter, the author of Gödel, Escher, Bach, organized scientists to write letters to the Nobel Committee recommending Wu for the physics prize. And in 2018, 1,600 researchers invoked Wu's name in an open letter to CERN challenging current-day sexism in physics. “[T]here are at least four women whose work is relevant for particle physics who are widely viewed as having deserved the Nobel prize but who did not receive it, in some cases even though their male colleagues did,” the letter says. Wu's name appears at the top of that list.",
            "negative33": "(“Bell inequalities” refers to the pioneering work of Northern Ireland physicist John Stewart Bell, who laid the foundations for the 2022 Physics Nobel in the early 1960s.) Colleagues agreed that the trio had it coming, deserving this reckoning for overthrowing reality as we know it. “It was long overdue,” says Sandu Popescu, a quantum physicist at the University of Bristol in England. “Without any doubt, the prize is well deserved.” “The experiments beginning with the earliest one of Clauser and continuing along show that this stuff isn't just philosophical, it's real—and like other real things, potentially useful,” says Charles H. Bennett, an eminent quantum researcher at IBM. “Each year I thought, ‘Oh, maybe this is the year,'” says David Kaiser, a physicist and historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2022 “it really was. It was very emotional—and very thrilling.” The journey from fringe to favor was a long one. From about 1940 until as late as 1990, studies of so-called quantum foundations were often treated as philosophy at best and crackpottery at worst. Many scientific journals refused to publish papers on the topic, and academic positions indulging such investigations were nearly impossible to come by. In 1985 Popescu's adviser warned him against a Ph.D. in the subject.",
            "negative34": "After overthrowing parity, Wu became the first woman to receive the Comstock Prize from the National Academy of Sciences; the first female president of the American Physical Society; the first physicist to receive the Wolf Prize; and the first living physicist to have an asteroid named in her honor. Her work pushed open doors to university teaching in the West for women and scientists of color. In China, she is revered. In 2021 the U.S. Postal Service released a Forever stamp with Wu's portrait. Today Wu's parity experiment is understood as an early step on the path to what would become the Standard Model of particle physics, and it points toward possible answers about why matter exists in our universe at all. Wu's early entanglement work, however, remained in obscurity. Sometimes by examining one part of a system, we begin to perceive a related link, at a distance. The 2022 Nobel Prize celebrated a set of connected experiments that took place at great distance from one another. Even though Wu couldn't have been awarded the prize posthumously, her early research is finally coming to light as a crucial part of that entangled history, thanks in large part to historians such as Silva. Society may prefer a hero narrative or the myth of a lone genius, but a closer look reveals that extraordinary science, like entanglement itself, depends fundamentally on connection.",
            "negative35": "She wanted to study whether the daughter particles of nuclear decay shot out in a symmetrical pattern—as all of mainstream physics believed they would—or if the radioactive patterns showed a preference for “right-handed” or “left-handed” behavior. She enlisted cooperation from the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now the NIST) in Washington, D.C., because, unlike many other labs, they had the technology and expertise to work at temperatures close to absolute zero. For months Wu commuted between New York City and Washington, overseeing graduate student work that supported the experiment. By January 1957, in close consultation with Yang and Lee, Wu and her NBS partners made an astonishing discovery. Beta-decay particles were slightly “left-handed,” not symmetrical as all of physics had assumed. As soon as it was announced, Yang, Lee and Wu, along with other experimentalists who followed Wu's work, found themselves on a national conference circuit, their names and images splashed across the popular press. When the American Physical Society met at the New York Hotel that year, they presented their findings in what the New Yorker called “the largest hall ... occupied by so immense a crowd that some of its members did everything but hang from the chandeliers.” That October, Yang and Lee became the first two Chinese Americans in history to win the Nobel Prize. Although Nobel rules allowed up to three award recipients each year, Wu was not included.",
            "negative36": "She favored traditional quantum-entanglement interpretations, not Bohm's theory. In 1971, when she designed a new version of the 1949 experiment, Wu wrote that it “should certainly quiet those proponents of the hidden variables.” When Clauser published his proposed test of Bell's theorem in 1969, he took care to distinguish the Wu-Shaknov experiment from his own. Clauser had wanted to prove hidden variables were real; instead, in 1972, he disproved the existence of hidden variables and demonstrated entanglement with even greater certainty. He had counted coincidences, much as Bell suggested, but there were far more coincidences than hidden variables could explain. Clauser's work prompted Aspect and Zeilinger's later experiments, which closed lingering loopholes and supported entanglement further. Together those experiments led to their 2022 Nobel Prize. By the time Bohm's paper on hidden variables emerged, much had changed in Wu's life. She had married and moved to the East Coast. She had broken a glass ceiling at Princeton, had a child and had become a U.S. citizen. She was on the faculty of Columbia University, though still not a full professor. In 1956 Wu's Columbia colleague T. D. Lee approached her for advice about an odd question. He and his research partner, Chen Ning Yang, wondered if some of the tiniest particles in the universe might violate long-established expectations.",
            "negative37": "What Bell tests allow physicists to do is remove the bias of anthropocentric aesthetic judgments from the equation. They purge from the work the parts of human cognition that recoil at the possibility of eerily inexplicable entanglement or that scoff at hidden variable theories as just more debates over how many angels may dance on the head of a pin. The award honors Clauser, Aspect and Zeilinger, but it is testament to all the researchers who were unsatisfied with superficial explanations about quantum mechanics and who asked their questions even when doing so was unpopular. “Bell tests,” Giustina concludes, “are a very useful way of looking at reality.”   Spooky Action.

One of its first successes in cryptology is messages sent using entangled pairs, which can send cryptographic keys in a secure manner — any eavesdropping will destroy the entanglement, alerting the receiver that something is wrong. In 2017, Dr. Zeilinger used this technique with entangled photons beamed from a Chinese satellite called Micius to have an encrypted 75-minute video conversation with Jian-Wei Pan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of his former students. When receiving the Nobel Prize on Tuesday, Dr. Zeilinger acknowledged the more than 100 young people who had worked for him over the years and described receiving the award as “an encouragement to young people.” Though he acknowledged that the award was honoring the future applications of his work, he said, “My advice would be: Do what you find interesting, and don’t care too much about possible applications.” However, with quantum mechanics, just because we can use it, doesn’t mean our ape brains understand it.

He was a few years junior to Wu when they were graduate students at Berkeley. Both had studied under Oppenheimer, and both worked in E. O. Lawrence's prestigious radiation laboratory. Bohm had every reason to know of Wu's stellar reputation. He acknowledged Wu in a footnote in his 1957 article. Silva traces how Wu's experimental work—in 1949 and later in 1971—prompted later entanglement experiments. Silva's findings were published in The Oxford Handbook of the History of Quantum Interpretation in 2022. She points out how Bohm's article about hidden variables inspired John Bell, who proposed that the number of quantum coincidences between particles could be predicted and counted. In 1964, in an obscure journal called Physics, Physique, Fizika, Bell discussed Bohm's 1957 paper (which referenced Wu's experiment) and launched his own new theory. A few years later at Columbia, a young Clauser found “Bell's Theorem” in the library.",
            "negative41": "“He said, ‘Look, if you do that, you will have fun for five years, and then you will be jobless,'” Popescu says. Today quantum information science is among the most vibrant subfields in all of physics. It links Einstein's general theory of relativity with quantum mechanics via the still mysterious behavior of black holes. It dictates the design and function of quantum sensors, which are increasingly being used to study everything from earthquakes to dark matter. And it clarifies the often confusing nature of quantum entanglement, a phenomenon that is pivotal to modern materials science and that lies at the heart of quantum computing. “What even makes a quantum computer ‘quantum?'” Nicole Yunger Halpern, a National Institute of Standards and Technology physicist, asks rhetorically. “One of the most popular answers is entanglement, and the main reason we understand entanglement is the grand work participated in by Bell and these Nobel Prize winners. Without that understanding of entanglement, we probably wouldn't be able to realize quantum computers.” The trouble with quantum mechanics was never that it made the wrong predictions—in fact, the theory described the microscopic world splendidly right from the start when physicists devised it in the opening decades of the 20th century. What Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen took issue with, as they explained in their iconic 1935 paper, was the theory's uncomfortable implications for reality.",

Political movements were calling for “science and democracy,” along with a generation of scholars who could elevate China's status. Wu was off to pursue a Ph.D. in physics. She would study under pioneers such as Emilio Segrè, Ernest Lawrence and J. Robert Oppenheimer.* At the University of California, Berkeley, Wu became a star student. Her dissertation research on the fission products of uranium was so sophisticated and sensitive that it was turned over to the military and embargoed until the end of World War II. Yet Wu had trouble finding a job after graduation. For two years she depended on mentors for research appointments. At the time, none of the top 20 research universities in the country had a woman on the physics faculty. Gender bias was not Wu's only obstacle. A year after her arrival in the U.S., the escalation of World War II cut off communication with China, and discrimination against Asian immigrants had intensified, especially on the West Coast.",

In the nearly 90 years since Einstein tried to kill quantum mechanics by highlighting the absurdity of entanglement, the phenomenon has become much more than fodder for philosophical debates. It’s one of the main engines driving the booming field of quantum information science. “Physicists are now starting to understand that entanglement and Bell pairs [are] a quantum resource that you can use to achieve amazing new things,” said Hansson. Zeilinger is one of the central figures leading the effort to work technological miracles with entanglement. In 1997, he and his colleagues were the first to pull off a feat known as quantum teleportation, which uses a precise protocol of measurements on entangled particles to transfer the polarization direction of one particle over to another without the researchers ever learning the polarization direction that was transported. The technique may come to play a crucial role in quantum computing. “It is not like in the Star Trek films or whatever, transporting something — certainly not a person — over some distance,” Zeilinger said by phone during the Nobel announcement. “The point is, using entanglement, you can transfer all the information that is carried by an object over to another place, where the object is, so to speak, reconstituted.",

In 1949 physicist Chien-Shiung Wu devised an experiment that documented evidence of entanglement. Her findings have been hidden in plain sight for more than 70 years In November 1949 Chien-Shiung Wu and her graduate student, Irving Shaknov, descended to a laboratory below Columbia University's Pupin Hall. They needed antimatter for a new experiment, so they made their own, using a machine called a cyclotron. The machine's multiton magnet was so gigantic that, according to university folklore, a decade earlier administrators had to blast a hole in an exterior wall and recruit the football team to maneuver the block of iron into the building. The magnetic field produced by a cyclotron accelerates particles to dizzying speeds. In the lab, Wu and Shaknov used it to bombard a sheet of copper with deuterons, generating an unstable isotope, Cu 64, as a source of positrons—the antimatter. When a positron and an electron collide, they annihilate each other, releasing two photons that fly apart in opposite directions. A few years earlier physicist John Wheeler had predicted that when matter and antimatter met, the resulting photons would be orthogonally polarized. Wu and Shaknov were looking for conclusive proof of Wheeler's so-called pair theory. They weren't the first.",

The three researchers will also split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, around $900,000. Their works have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In winning the award on Wednesday, Dr. Sharpless became only the fifth person to win two Nobels, having received the chemistry prize in 2001 for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions.

The Nobel Prize in physics for 2022 is being awarded to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger for their work on quantum mechanics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced on October 4, 2022.  The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded “for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities, and pioneering quantum information science,” the academy said. The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation. The result was a clear violation of a Bell inequality and agreed with the predictions of quantum mechanics."

In the first half, the Bengals were mostly able to control the rush with an efficient run game, Joe Burrow quickly getting rid of the ball and a commitment to turning their protection toward Aaron Donald as much as possible. In the first half, the Rams had seven pressures, but Burrow was sacked only once. Then Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris adjusted and the much-talked-about mismatch materialized. In the second half, the Rams had 11 pressures and six sacks.  Morris’ adjustment was simple: He started blitzing as he had throughout the playoffs. Bringing five rushers created one-on-ones for the Rams’ pass rushers and clogged up running lanes for Burrow, who won previous playoff games with his ability to get away from pressure.

There is a fascinating restraint-and-release, shift-and-surge control with which Donald plays. Anyone can be a wild man, but Donald has a regulator that allows him to be at his most powerful and detonating when it counts, to outsmart and outmaneuver the opponent in the face of all the violence to ruin the most important play. That’s what makes him “an official game wrecker,” as Morris calls him. Recall a close, heated 2018 game between the Rams and the Seattle Seahawks, when a fight broke out near the Rams’ sideline between Donald and one of the Seahawks, Justin Britt. As the two men began shoving, other players surrounded them. A thrown punch might have meant ejection from the game. Rams Coach Sean McVay ran into the melee and frantically peeled players away trying to get to his star defender — “Get out!” he ordered, “Get out!” — until he reached Donald.

It gives you greater appreciation for being a champion.\" Mahomes acknowledged that there was a huge difference between his reaction to winning this title and his first championship, a victory over San Francisco in Super Bowl LIV. Mahomes compared that first accomplishment to a wide-eyed kid taking home a prize from the fair. There was a whirlwind of success, accompanied by an offseason of celebrating and an attempt at a repeat that ended with that blowout loss to Tampa Bay in Super Bowl LV. Then came an overtime loss to Cincinnati in last year's AFC Championship Game, a defeat that had plenty to do with Mahomes playing his worst half of football in a second-half meltdown against the Bengals. Mahomes grew from all those moments in ways that weren't that visible when this regular season began. There was so much attention paid to the trade that sent Hill to Miami and all the blockbuster personnel moves made by the rest of the AFC West that it seemed as if the Chiefs were more vulnerable than ever.

Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

Fans have been anticipating the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree release date ever since they sat upon the throne and became the Elden Lord. While you could spend hundreds of hours playing Elden Ring, the most hardcore players have spent several months clamouring for an expansion.   As one of the best PC games, the Elden Ring community has been waiting for this eventful day for some time. FromSoftware, the developers behind the RPG game, had an opportunity to reveal the DLC at The Game Awards 2022 when they won the coveted Game of the Year award. Elden Ring also celebrated its first birthday recently, but the devs waited a few days until they revealed they were working on the Elden Ring expansion. Here’s everything you need to know about the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree release date, including what it might be about, and when you can expect to play it.    There currently is no Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree release date. Given the lack of information about the upcoming expansion, we’re expecting the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC to launch in 2024.",

Publisher Bandai Namco gave fans a new look at the epic fantasy role-playing game during Thursday’s Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live stream. The new trailer for Elden Ring showed gameplay for the first time, gameplay that will look very familiar to fans of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. We also got a release date — Jan. 21, 2022 — and platforms. Elden Ring is coming to current-gen and last-gen consoles, as well as PC. Elden Ring appears to have many elements familiar to Dark Souls players: swords and sorcery, summonable allies, and giant mythical monsters to battle. But it also has something fans of FromSoftware aren’t accustomed to: horses! Check out new 4K images of Elden Ring in the gallery below.

Developers credited the scale with responsibility for creating a sense of diversity, and intended the roleplaying elements to allow for a variety of player-environment interactions. Increasing the game's scale required the creation of several explorable structures, which the team conjoined in the open world.[33] Miyazaki named Shadow of the Colossus, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher 3, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild  as design influences for Elden Ring. He also credited the table-top RPG RuneQuest, and the novels The Lord of the Rings and The Eternal Champion as inspirations for the game's story.[34][35] Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Tai Tomisawa, Yuka Kitamura, and Yoshimi Kudo composed Elden Ring's original soundtrack.[36]  Elden Ring was revealed during an Xbox games conference at E3 2019.[37][38] Some information about the game had previously been leaked online due to a vulnerability of the servers at Bandai Namco Entertainment.[39] Elden Ring was widely anticipated on announcement but no further material was released until a trailer was shown in June 2021.",

It’s been a near ever-present in the steam charts since its release in February and you’d certainly be hard pushed to find a better Game of the Year contender outside FromSoftware’s latest action RPG. But despite many fans diving back into the game over and over again (there is 6 endings after all), most of the community are desperate to see what the developer does with the game next, especially with regards to more post-launch content. At this point, nothing has been officially announced with both FromSoftware and Publisher Bandai Namco avoiding any concrete answers on the future of the game. That being said, FromSoftware does have a history of releasing DLC for their previous titles. Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice all received hefty post-launch support and content updates. There have also been hints in press releases, with one including a quote from Bandai Namco Entertainment President and CEO Yasuo Miyakawa which talks about “expanding the brand beyond the game itself”. Clearly Bandai Namco know they need to capitalise on a game as significant as Elden Ring, and you would imagine one of the easiest ways to do that would be via post launch content.",

An upcoming expansion for Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree, is currently in development. We hope you look forward to new adventures in the Lands Between.”      Judging by this excellent spot on Reddit, the image in the tweet appears to be Miquella, Malenia’s twin brother, riding Torrent across a field. The field doesn’t look like the ones we’re used to in The Lands Between which points to the Shadow of the Erdtree story taking place in the past, or in another world entirely. While you’re able to fight Malenia as one of the toughest Elden Ring bosses the open-world game has to offer, you never get the chance to see Miquella in his original state.    Exploring the past isn’t a new concept for FromSoftware. The first and only Dark Souls DLC, Artorias of the Abyss, sent players hundreds of years into the past to confront Manus, Father of the Abyss. Time travel isn’t something we’ve seen in Elden Ring, but that doesn’t mean we won’t see it in the future.    There’s a chance the expansion could take place inside Miquella’s dream.",

Miyazaki said he enjoyed writing NPCs with more detail, believing they are more compelling than those in his earlier works.[27][29] In an interview with IGN, Miyazaki said he chose to give Martin control over the backstory because of the restrictions FromSoftware's method of storytelling placed on writers. He noted FromSoftware did not want a linear or story-focused game, and by giving Martin oversight of a backstory with which the player is not directly involved, he could allow Martin to freely design his contributions.[26] Some staff from Game of Thrones, a television series adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, also assisted with the game's development.[30]  Production of the game began in early 2017 following the release of The Ringed City, a piece of downloadable content (DLC) for Dark Souls III. Elden Ring was developed alongside Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which Miyazaki also directed. He said although the combat in Elden Ring has similarities to that in Sekiro, neither game directly inspired the mechanics of the other.[31][32] FromSoftware simultaneously develop both games using a \"co-director\" structure in which each of the games had a staff member acting as director through its first stages of development.",

R. Martin's heavy inclusion in the marketing was \"baffling\" when his contributions to the overall narrative were unclear.[72] Mitchell Saltzman did not mind the lack of Martin's style, saying the side-stories rather than any grand, overarching plot kept him \"enthralled\".[70]  Elden Ring sold 13.4 million copies worldwide by the end of March 2022,[87] and 20 million by February 2023.[88] It was the best-selling game in several regions between February and March 2022,[89][90] and is the fastest-selling Bandai Namco game of all time.[91][92] It was the second-bestselling game of 2022 in the US after Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II,[93] the third-bestselling in Europe,[94] and the tenth-bestselling in Japan at retail.[95]  Elden Ring won many awards and accolades.",

What are the chances we see an announcement for Elden Ring DLC? Fingers crossed!  Given that both the publisher and developer have not officially announced any Elden Ring DLC at the time of writing it’s very difficult to give a firm release date for when we might see the game launch some DLC. However, when we look at FromSoftware’s past DLC outings it’s possible to give fans a rough release window which might hint at when we could see the game’s first DLC update. As you can see from the table above, FromSoftware normally release DLC within a year of launching the game. Obviously, there’s no exact pattern, but likewise, we don’t think the publisher will want to wait over a year for DLC if they want to capitalise on the game’s incredible popularity in 2022. Let’s just hope it’s not another case of what we saw with Demon’s Souls, which received no post-launch DLC content. We’ll be sure to update this page with more details as and when we can. That’s a tricky question, since FromSoftware don’t normally have a set number of DLC drops for each game.

The developers concentrated on environmental scale, roleplaying, and the story; the scale required the construction of several structures inside the open world.  Elden Ring received critical acclaim for its open-world, gameplay systems, and setting, with some criticism for its technical performance. It won multiple Game of the Year awards and sold over 20 million copies in a year. An expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, was announced in February 2023.  Elden Ring is a third-person perspective, action, role-playing game with a focus on combat and exploration. It includes elements that are similar to those in other FromSoftware-developed games such as the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The game is set in an open world; players can freely explore the Lands Between and its six main areas, which include Limgrave—an area of grassy plains and ancient ruins—and Caelid, a wasteland that is home to undead monsters.[1] Open-world areas are explored using the character's mount Torrent as the main mode of travel; players can also use fast travel outside combat. Throughout the game, players encounter non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies, including demigods who rule each main area and serve as the game's main bosses.",

The most common answer was not an already announced game or theoretical sequel, but actually DLC for an existing game, namely this year’s GOTY frontrunner, Elden Ring. And doing the math, announcing DLC for Elden Ring at the Game Awards, a show where it seems somewhat likely to win Game of the Year, actually may add up quite perfectly. With Elden Ring debuting in late February 2022, early December would be just over nine months after the release of the game. Elden Ring is already on the late side when it comes to debuting DLC compared to previous FromSoftware games, as I’ve documented in the past:   So, by this time, Dark Souls 2 and 3 and Bloodborne all had DLC out. In terms of just announcement of DLC, we are way past due. Bloodborne’s Old Hunters DLC was announced six months after release, two months before it came out. Dark Souls 2’s DLC was announced only three months after the game launched. Elden Ring What’s taking so long?

            "negative18": "So tack on some extra time for that reason alone. Second, with Elden Ring, there’s simply zero need to rush. The game is a huge best-seller, miles beyond anything else FromSoftware has produced, so it could release DLC tomorrow or another six months from now and it would still sell exceptionally well. And it’s possible they may have timed this all out to perfection. Imagine Elden Ring winning Game of the Year the same night it announces its long-anticipated DLC at the Game Awards. I can’t picture any better way to immediately drive millions of pre-sales for that content. My guess is that Elden Ring DLC would be more involved and expansive than past FromSoftware DLC, mainly because Elden Ring itself is more expansive. I suppose it’s not impossible that they skip DLC and just start work on their next game, as DLC has somewhat fallen out of favor for big games in recent years (GTA 5, despite all its sales, never did paid single player story DLC), but it really seems like it’s going to happen.

If another player interacts with the sign, the player who placed the sign is summoned into their world. Cooperative players remain in the same world until the boss of the area is defeated or until a summoned player dies and is returned to their home world. In PvP combat, a summon sign is used to challenge another player to a duel, or the player can use additional items to invade the worlds of others. World hosts may use a \"taunter's tongue\" to increase the likelihood their world will be invaded by others and to decrease the time between invasions.[20][21][22]  Elden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, a fictional realm over which several demigods rule. It was previously ruled over by the immortal Queen Marika, who acted as keeper of the Elden Ring, a powerful force that manifested itself as the physical concept of order. When Marika shattered the Elden Ring and disappeared, her demigod children began fighting over pieces of the Ring in an event called The Shattering.

We’d like to think that Bandai Namco would throw suitcases of money at FromSoftware to ensure the good times keep on rolling with more and more content, but truthfully it’s a complete guess as to how much the company will look to expand on the game. Our modest estimation is that we’ll see at least two DLC releases for the game, if not more.  There’s no telling which direction any Elden Ring DLC could take players, but thankfully we have a few ideas… Some fans have noticed that the Elden Ring Divine Tower locations appear to converge on one central point on the Elden Ring map. Surprisingly, the Erdree isn’t at the centre of these Tower locations, but rather a mysterious clouded region which sits in the middle of an ocean.

Elden Ring was designed to have a more-expansive environment than the narrow dungeons of FromSoftware's previous games; Miyazaki hoped the grander scale would add freedom and depth to exploration. FromSoftware approached American author George R. R. Martin, creator of the fantasy-novel series A Song of Ice and Fire, to provide worldbuilding for Elden Ring. Miyazaki, who is a fan of Martin's work, hoped Martin's contributions would produce a more-accessible narrative than those the studio's earlier games.[25][26][27]  Miyazaki remained lead writer for the game's main storyline but gave Martin creative freedom to write about events that occurred before the main narrative. Miyazaki compared the process to using a \"dungeon master's handbook in a tabletop RPG\".",

First things first: you want to know how hard this game is, right? “How hard is Elden Ring?” we hear you ask. The game may have been designed for “all sorts of players” and not just “hardened veterans” (as per FromSoftware marketing and communications manager Yasuhiro Kitao) but don’t let that dissuade you if you are a hardcore fan: game director and master of all things sadistic Hidetaka Miyazaki says that Elden Ring is about as hard as Dark Souls 3. As per the director, the game has been made so that players will find it “very difficult, but it can be handled.” Don’t expect difficulty settings, then, or any hand-holding throughout the entire experience. Veteran Soulsbourne players, eat your hearts out.  Miyazaki explains that he feels “the difficulty level as a pure action game is lower.” Instead, Miyazaki states “I think that the closest image of difficulty is Dark Souls III.",

This means that Splatoon 3 development had not started as of July 2019 and presumably started after the release of Version 5.0.0 on 31 July 2019.[4] This is quite different compared to the timing of the development of Splatoon 2, which started immediately after Splatoon was released.

It sold quickly, and with 10.67 million copies sold, was approximately the eighteenth-best-selling Nintendo Switch title.[1]  Following the Team Chaos victory in the Chaos vs. Order Splatfest, Splatoon 3's style is very chaotic, bringing post-apocalyptic, patchwork, and other chaotic elements together with the styles of both previous games.  Splatoon 3 expands the Splatoon series on many different fronts, with an extensive story mode, new Salmon Run challenges and rewards, a wider range of customisation with more options (including the additions of Splashtags and the locker room), and the new mode Tableturf Battle. Additionally, Splatoon 3 streamlines many aspects of the previous games. The Battle Lobby has been reworked into a greatly-expanded practice area accessible between matches, Splatfests are overhauled with three teams rather than two and a new Tricolor Turf War mode, and the UI has been made more responsive and informative.

The game was first revealed in a teaser trailer on 17 February 2021 and was subsequently released on 9 September 2022.  The game received generally favorable reviews, with praise for its additional maps, single player campaign, customization options, and gameplay mechanics, but criticism for its matchmaking and disconnection issues and lack of new content. As of 31 March 2023 Splatoon 3 has now sold 10.67 million copies worldwide, making it the fastest-selling game in the franchise and one of the best-selling Switch games.[5]  Like its predecessors in the Splatoon series, Splatoon 3 is a third-person shooter. Players choose to be either an Inkling or Octoling as their player character. Both wield weaponry that uses colored ink as ammunition.

I ain't talking about the Beach Boy – I'm talking about the cowboy,\" she said with a grin as the camera panned to her father standing proudly in the audience. She extended gratitude to her fans old and new, saying, \"I know I'm new to a lot of folks, but I won't let y'all down I promise you,\" to close out her speech."

For most photos, every four pixels are combined into one large quad pixel for even better low-light performance. The 48-megapixel lens also enables a 2x Telephoto mode that uses the middle 12 megapixels for full-resolution photos with no digital zoom. This joins the existing 3x zoom enabled by the dedicated Telephoto lens, which has also been improved.   The iPhone 14 Pro models are able to shoot at the full 48MP with ProRAW, enabling the new iPhones to take impressive professional photos. Second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization reduces shake and blur, and a new 12 megapixel Ultra Wide camera has larger pixels for sharper images with more details and a better macro mode. The TrueDepth front-facing camera has an improved f/1.9 aperture for better low-light selfies and videos, and it supports autofocus for the first time. The Adaptive True Tone flash has been redesigned with an array of nine LEDs that change pattern based on the lens focal length.

            "negative12": "Apple has again stirred things up a bit with its iPhone 14 lineup. While Apple’s latest iPhone models feature some nice enhancements — especially for the more expensive iPhone 14 Pro — Apple has also taken one thing away with this latest iPhone release. For the first time in the history of the iPhone, Apple is removing the slot for a physical SIM card. Instead, all iPhone 14 models sold in the U.S. will exclusively use embedded SIMs (eSIMs). It’s not the first time Apple has removed a physical connector to slim down the iPhone and make space for other more important components. In 2016, Apple “courageously” removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, citing the emerging era of wireless headphones. It likely wasn’t a coincidence that Apple debuted the original AirPods at that same event. Perhaps ironically, this latest change brings the iPhone 14 into line with Steve Jobs’ original visions for its design. Earlier this year, former Apple executive Tony Fadell shared how Apple’s legendary co-founder and CEO was initially very much against the idea of having a SIM card slot on the original iPhone. During an interview with Joanna Stern at a special event for The Computer History Museum, Fadell explained how the oft-mercurial Apple CEO told the designers and engineers working on the original iPhone that “we don’t need another hole in it.",

All of these have a physical SIM card slot, except for those sold in China, which don’t use eSIM cards at all; instead, Chinese iPhones include two physical SIM card slots. Still, this likely heralds the beginning of a new trend. Apple worked with U.S. carriers over the last year to prepare them for the eSIM transition, but by next year, we could see the iPhone 15 launching without a physical SIM card slot in even more places. As great as the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro are, they're both already a few months old at this point, and the rumors about the iPhone 15 are well underway. We still have several months before the iPhone 15 models drop, though, as Apple usually makes iPhone announcements in the fall. In other words, there's still a lot of time for more rumors to make the rounds -- and make the rounds they will. We're keeping all of the reports and rumors of the iPhone 15 here in a single place for your convenience, but do remember to keep in mind that these are all still just speculation. Nothing is final until Apple confirms it during an official announcement. Still, a lot of the rumors give us an idea of what to expect each year, which is unfortunate if you like surprises.",

Wong also shared his thoughts on the new Deep Purple and Space Black color options: Wong shared Geekbench 5 results for the iPhone 14 Pro models, revealing up to a 16% increase in multi-core performance compared to the 13 Pro: The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern said iPhone 14 Pro models did not get significantly longer battery life than iPhone 13 Pro models: Like the iPhone 13 Pro models, the iPhone 14 Pro models use the same flat-sided design with squared off edges that harkens back to the iPhone 4. When it comes to the chassis, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max are almost identical to the iPhone 13 Pro models with an all-glass front and a textured matte glass back that sandwich a frame made from surgical-grade stainless steel.",

Wide color support provides vivid, true-to-life colors, and True Tone matches the white balance of the display to the ambient lighting of the room the device is in for a paper-like viewing experience that's meant to be easier on the eyes. There's also a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating and support for Haptic Touch, which provides haptic feedback when interacting with the display. There is no notch on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models, with Apple doing away with a design it has used since the 2017 iPhone X. Apple has redesigned the TrueDepth camera hardware, placing the proximity sensor under the display and using smaller cutouts for the camera, the dot projector, and other components.   The display has a small circular cutout on the right side that's for the camera, and a pill-shaped cutout on the left side for the TrueDepth system for Face ID. Apple is using software to combine these two cutouts into one pill-shaped cutout that is calling the \"Dynamic Island.\" The Dynamic Island is not just a cutout, with Apple turning it into part of the interface.",
            "negative28": "The color of the stainless steel frame matches the color of the glass at the back for a streamlined look.  Apple did away with the notch for the iPhone 14 Pro models, instead introducing what it's calling the \"Dynamic Island,\" which we'll explain in more detail below. Design wise, the Dynamic Island consists of a pill-shaped cutout and a circular cutout, both of which house the TrueDepth camera system. Apple blends the pill-shaped cutout and circular cutout into one larger pill, which is 30 percent smaller than the notch. There are antenna bands at the top and sides of the phone, along with a Lightning port for charging. In the United States, there is no longer a SIM slot at the left side of the device, but in some other countries, the physical SIM hardware remains. A durable Ceramic Shield display protects the front of the device. Apple says that the Ceramic Shield is made by infusing nano-ceramic crystals into glass, optimizing for clarity and toughness. The Ceramic Shield is meant to provide better protection against scratches and everyday wear and tear.   A square camera bump is located at the back of the iPhone 14 Pro models, and the bump is larger than it was last year to accommodate new camera technology. There is a triple-lens camera setup, and each individual lens is also larger in size.  The iPhone 14 Pro is a 6.1-inch smartphone, while the iPhone 14 Pro Max measures in at 6.",

All four of this year’s iPhones have immaculate build quality. Externally, you may only notice two differences. First, there’s no outline where the SIM card tray once popped out (more on that below). Second: In addition to carrying over silver and gold from last year, this year’s Pro phones introduce Space Black and an all new shade called Deep Purple, a dark but attractive color which can look grey in some light but gleams in others. Turn the phone on, though, and it’s instantly apparent this is a different phone. Instead of the clear cut-out docked at the top of the display, a smaller pill-shaped cut—not quite large enough to call a notch, and certainly not as obtrusive as the previous notch—provides space for the front camera lenses. This space quickly fades away as you start using the phone and surface the fresh, new Dynamic Island interface element which Apple uses to disguise the cut-out in the most enjoyable way imaginable. (More below.) Turn the iPhone over and the familiar matte-finish back with glossy camera panel is visible.

For most photos, every four pixels are combined into one large quad pixel for even better low-light performance. The 48-megapixel lens also enables a 2x Telephoto mode that uses the middle 12 megapixels for full-resolution photos with no digital zoom. This joins the existing 3x zoom enabled by the dedicated Telephoto lens, which has also been improved.   The iPhone 14 Pro models are able to shoot at the full 48MP with ProRAW, enabling the new iPhones to take impressive professional photos. Second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization reduces shake and blur, and a new 12 megapixel Ultra Wide camera has larger pixels for sharper images with more details and a better macro mode. The TrueDepth front-facing camera has an improved f/1.9 aperture for better low-light selfies and videos, and it supports autofocus for the first time.

There aren't many surprises left, but we should finally find out the price and launch date. For context, the device is not meant to compete with the Galaxy Tab series but will instead be targeted at those looking for a basic tablet to keep at home for everyday use. I/O 2023 will also give us better insights into all the new bells and whistles of Android 14, especially new privacy and security features. We're not expecting Android 14 to be a major update by any means, but we did see some minor but nifty features in the Android 14 Beta 1. Google released its debut smartwatch, the Pixel Watch, at I/O last year... and it's not great. The device suffers from poor battery life, a small screen, huge bezels, and has some features locked behind a subscription paywall. All that's on top of the hefty $350 price tag.

I'm excited to show you how we’re driving that mission forward in two key ways: by deepening our understanding of information so that we can turn it into knowledge; and advancing the state of computing, so that knowledge is easier to access, no matter who or where you are. Today, you'll see how progress on these two parts of our mission ensures Google products are built to help. I’ll start with a few quick examples. Throughout the pandemic, Google has focused on delivering accurate information to help people stay healthy. Over the last year, people used Google Search and Maps to find where they could get a COVID vaccine nearly two billion times. Google’s flood forecasting technology sent flood alerts to 23 million people in India and Bangladesh last year. We’ve also expanded our flood forecasting technology to help people stay safe in the face of natural disasters. During last year’s monsoon season, our flood alerts notified more than 23 million people in India and Bangladesh. And we estimate this supported the timely evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people.",

Somehow, the weird, wacky also-ran had ballooned into the most surefire awards juggernaut in recent memory — every award everywhere all at once! — a trajectory that echoes the drama of the movie itself. After all, if the biggest failure in the multiverse can turn out to be its savior, why can’t an unlikely awards contender defy its own statistical improbabilities and realize its Oscar dream? The Academy Awards have, to their credit, become less and less statistic-dependent anyway. The academy is a more diverse, more international organization than it was several years ago, and its tastes are not easy to pin down. There is no easy-to-follow template for a best picture anymore (if there ever was), and films that enter the race reeking too obviously of traditional Oscar quality— a group that includes not only “The Fabelmans” but also two earlier Spielberg pictures, “The Post” and “West Side Story” — run the risk of falling by the wayside.",

Could the academy’s generosity ever extend, in future, to a more intimate, truthful, modestly scaled drama of Asian American life? A movie that prioritizes the specific over the multiversal, with subtler insights and fewer hot-dog fingers? I sure hope so — even if, for now, the wiener takes it all. From the Oscars to the Emmys.

This year's Oscars are returning to the beloved Dolby Theatre on Sunday after having switched to a more Covid-friendly venue last year. For the first time since 2018, the show will have hosts again. And, of course, parties (lots of them) are being held all across Los Angeles.  But there's still a global pandemic — so there will still be some changes to the show.  Here's everything you need to know about the 94th Academy Awards. After a few host-less years, the Oscars are bringing not one but three people to the stage to keep viewers entertained. Wanda Sykes, Amy Schumer and Regina Hall were officially named as the hosts last month — marking the first time the ceremony has had a host since Jimmy Kimmel took the stage in 2018. Kevin Hart, the comedian who was tapped to emcee the show in 2019, exited in an outcry over past homophobic tweets, and the group behind the Oscars carried on without a host. Presenters, performers and some nominees.  This year’s Oscars will be smaller than in the pre-pandemic days.

The news was confirmed to the publication by Bill Kramer, the CEO of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who added: “We are committed to having a show that celebrates the artisans, the arts and sciences and the collaborative nature of moviemaking. This is very much what the mission of the Academy is, and I am very hopeful that we can do a show that celebrates all components of moviemaking in an entertaining and engaging way.”  As for the rest of the show? “All I will say right now is that our anniversary, the 95th Oscars, is extremely important to us,” he said. “I think it sets a really interesting rhythm for our 100th.

By Matthew Futterman Reporting from Melbourne, Australia Aryna Sabalenka is no longer afraid of big stages. Overcoming a history of buckling under the pressure of late-round Grand Slam tennis, Sabalenka, the powerful 24-year-old from Belarus, came from behind to beat Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the women’s singles final of the Australian Open on Saturday. In a matchup of two of the biggest hitters in the sport, Sabalenka was a little more fearless and a few clicks more clinical than Rybakina in the crucial moments to cap off a dominant summer of tennis in Australia. It was Sabalenka’s first Grand Slam title in a rocky career that has included the kind of error-ridden, big-moment meltdowns from which some players almost never recover. Instead, the match proved a microcosm of Sabalenka’s career — a shaky start, filled with ill-timed double faults followed by a steadying midmatch recovery before a final-set display of raw power and precision that her opponent could not answer.

Entering the finals, Rybakina led the field with in aces with 45. Sabalenka was third with 29. They were first and second in hitting winners off their opponents’ serve, and at the top of the charts in peak serve speed, with both cracking 120 miles per hour. Subtle, deft, tennis this was not, and for Rybakina it was so different from her championship match at Wimbledon in July, when she played Ons Jabeur of Tunisia, one of the most creative players in the game.

It’s Belarus v Kazakhstan and between two players seeking to break into the gap at the top of the women’s game. Rybakina is mentally tough, while Sabelenka has the power. Both six-footers, they have the game to win this tournament and it seems a close one to call.

She reached the Wimbledon final earlier this summer and held a one-set lead before tightening and getting overpowered by Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan. Ahead of Saturday, she spoke of the lessons she had learned from that match and how she now knew ways to keep her emotions in check.

Heading into the match, Nadal led their head-to-head 3–1.[2] However, Medvedev entered the final with a 13-match win streak at the majors, having won the 2021 US Open final in straight sets against the world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. Medvedev's hardcourt record in the previous 12 months and Nadal's injury-ridden 2021 season, which included a six-month absence from competitive tennis, led to Medvedev being considered the favorite prior to the match.[3][4]  The match began at 7:47 pm local time and ended at 1:11 am the following day.

However, the second set displayed a different Collins, who immediately broke the Australian - her second service game of the tournament - to jump out to 2-0. Barty managed to stem the momentum but was outmatched for majority of the set, resulting in the American holding a 5-1 lead. Barty said after the match that she needed to change her tactics at this stage or face a deciding set. “Once I was 1-5 down, I just wanted to try and shift and be a little more aggressive, adjust a couple of things tactically just to get momentum if we went to a third,” Barty said. “Tennis is a funny game with the scoring system. Things can change so quickly it feels like at times.” The Australian reeled off five of the next six games to force a tiebreak. A calm Barty then sealed a sensational victory in 87 minutes, roaring as she struck a forehand winner to win the tiebreak and secure the title in front of a home crowd.

The pair faced each other in another final, at the 2019 US Open, which was also a five-set match in Nadal's favor. Medvedev, 25, has a near-identical playing approach as Nadal, returning far behind the baseline and covering the court with impressive speed. On paper, Medvedev holds the advantage as a better hard court player whereas Nadal is known to be more dominant on clay court. At 6 feet, 6 inches, Medvedev also sports a massive serve and impenetrable defense. Medvedev was aiming to follow his 2021 US Open title with a consecutive Grand Slam win and had another chance to play spoiler to history.

It’s more about you than it’s about me.” Well, she had a lot to do with it, of course. Those serves that produced 17 aces, helping erase the sting of seven double-faults. Those hammered groundstrokes and relentlessly aggressive style that produced 51 winners, 20 more than Rybakina’s total. And, despite her go-for-broke shotmaking, somehow Sabalenka limited her unforced error count to 28. One more key statistic: Sabalenka managed to accrue 13 break points, converting three, including the one at 4-3 in the last set that put her ahead for good. “She played really well today,” said Rybakina, who has lost all four matches she’s played against Sabalenka, all in three sets. “She was strong mentally, physically.",

Rybakina came through a tough service game to lead 3-2, but could not withstand Sabalenka's pressure for much longer as the Belarusian converted her third break point of the game to go into a 4-3 lead. There were understandable nerves as the 24-year-old from Minsk served for the title but, when Rybakina sent a forehand long on match point number four, she fell onto her back and cried tears of joy. After several near-misses, many had doubted whether she had the temperament to win a Slam having made the semi-finals at the last two US Opens and Wimbledon 2021.

She hung in there until a fourth chance to close out Elena Rybakina presented itself — and this time, Sabalenka saw a forehand from her similarly powerful foe sail long. That was that. The championship belonged to Sabalenka via a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback victory over Wimbledon winner Rybakina. “The last game, yeah, of course, I was a little bit nervous. I (kept) telling myself, like, ’Nobody tells you that it’s going to be easy.’ You just have to work for it, work for it, ’til the last point,” said Sabalenka, a 24-year-old from Belarus who is now 11-0 with two titles in 2023 and will rise to No. 2 in the WTA rankings on Monday. “I’m super happy that I was able to handle all those emotions,” she said, “and win this one.” The only set she has dropped all season was the opener on Saturday against Rybakina, who eliminated No.",

Swiatek takes the first point with a sweeping backhand. They’re knocking up, and calmly so. No wind in Philippe Chatrier, we are told, but who does that favour? The bigger server perhaps, making it Swiatek. Gauff is the youngest finalist in any slam since Sharpova in 2004. The players take to the court, Coco Gauff coming out first to plenty of cheers. Swiatek’s applause may be a little louder. Mat Wilander on the Eurosport broadcast suggests Gauff should concentrate on tennis, rather than “life”, which could be read as a kick against her activism. It certainly felt like that. It’s the men’s final tomorrow, and Nadal is going for the decimocuarto, his 14th, though perhaps a bit luckily after Sasha Zverev’s injury yesterday. Casper Ruud took his time to beat Marin Cilic but eventually got the job done. The hype is building up in Paris, and so is the heat.

A break back. *Swiatek 6-1 1-2 Gauff Better from Swiatek, as she speeds around the court to set herself off to a head start of 30-0. Only for a disguised drop shot to catch her out. But then Gauff is tempted into overcooking another forehand, before Swiatek sweeps a winner home. An important hold for Swiatek. Swiatek 6-1 0-2 Gauff* Coco rising, and she serves two beauties to go 30-0 up. Swiatek wins the next rally by coming to the net but then can’t get a backhand over. The Pole looks annoyed. Then Gauff nets, only to plonk an overhead down and out of reach to take the game and hold her serve. *Swiatek 6-1 0-1 Gauff Hello there!

With Jabeur putting up so little resistance, she didn’t need to do much more than hit deep into the court. Eventually, Jabeur either made an error or landed a shot somewhere around the service line, allowing Swiatek to move in and blast away. The first set was over in 30 minutes. The queens of women’s tennis historically have done this sort of thing. Jabeur, the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open Era and to reach the highest level of the sport, has arguably the most creative arsenal in the women’s game. When she is on, she can mix jumping backhand drop shots with a dangerous forehand and a deceptively hard serve that she can land in the corners with nasty movement. She reached the Wimbledon final earlier this summer and held a one-set lead before tightening and getting overpowered by Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan. Ahead of Saturday, she spoke of the lessons she had learned from that match and how she now knew ways to keep her emotions in check. But with Swiatek in top form, there was little that Jabeur, who has become an inspiration for Arab women, could do to stop the locomotive. “We’re going to get that title sometime soon,” she said after losing her second Grand Slam final of the year.",

I hope it's going to continue being like that.\" Gauff was in her first Grand Slam final -- it was the first time she'd advanced past the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam event -- and while she'd played in some big matches before, this was much different against an opponent locked in from the first serve.  Swiatek broke Gauff's serve in the first game and raced out to a 4-0 lead before Gauff could catch her breath and get a hold to win her only game of the first set.

And soon, a roar as Swiatek lands herself two championship points. The first is taken as Gauff misses her return. Swiatek is champion for a second time.  Swiatek 6-1 5-3 Gauff* Swiatek will have to serve this out. A Gauff forehand error wipes away the good work done by a backhand for 15-15. Then comes another one into the net for 15-30.

With Saturday’s win, she captured her third French Open singles title in four years. Since 2019, her record in the tournament heading into the final was 28-2, which may not rival the 112-3 record of Rafael Nadal, but give her time.

Other than the occasional battle with her psyche, she seems to be getting better each year, especially at the French Open, a tournament she loves more than any other.

In March, Ashleigh Barty of Australia, a three-time Grand Slam singles champion and the world No. 1, abruptly retired at 25 years old, saying she had accomplished all she wanted in the sport and was ready for a new challenge. In her departure, Barty, then the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, left a significant void in women’s tennis, which has largely been a free-for-all in recent years. No woman has won more than two Grand Slam titles in a calendar year since Williams won three in 2015. Since late 2020, Swiatek has done all she can to bring some order to women’s tennis, winning three of the past 10 Grand Slam titles. Beyond her dominance on the court, Swiatek has assumed a leadership role off it. She has spoken out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine more than any player who is not from Ukraine and has helped raise more than $2 million for relief efforts through her participation in tennis exhibitions, one of which she organized herself. “We’re trying to do our best to be good people,” she said during the trophy ceremony, as red-and-white Polish flags swung throughout the stands.",

Muchova’s lead lasted seven minutes, until an ill-timed drop shot settled to the bottom of the net and Swiatek was even once more and hearing the deafening chants of her name to the beat of a bass drum. “Iga is No. 1 in the world and I was so close,” Muchova said. With Muchova serving to stay in the match, Swiatek took dead aim on her returns at Muchova’s feet and nailed her targets, putting Muchova on her heels and in a quick hole. Double match point arrived as Muchova pulled a forehand wide. With a double-fault from Muchova, Swiatek had her crown, the queen of clay for another year. “Sorry for being so difficult,” she told her team during the awards ceremony. Four Grand Slam finals.

With Jabeur putting up so little resistance, she didn’t need to do much more than hit deep into the court. Eventually, Jabeur either made an error or landed a shot somewhere around the service line, allowing Swiatek to move in and blast away. The first set was over in 30 minutes. The queens of women’s tennis historically have done this sort of thing. Jabeur, the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open Era and to reach the highest level of the sport, has arguably the most creative arsenal in the women’s game. When she is on, she can mix jumping backhand drop shots with a dangerous forehand and a deceptively hard serve that she can land in the corners with nasty movement. She reached the Wimbledon final earlier this summer and held a one-set lead before tightening and getting overpowered by Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan. Ahead of Saturday, she spoke of the lessons she had learned from that match and how she now knew ways to keep her emotions in check. But with Swiatek in top form, there was little that Jabeur, who has become an inspiration for Arab women, could do to stop the locomotive. “We’re going to get that title sometime soon,” she said after losing her second Grand Slam final of the year.",
            "negative20": "That loss sent her spiraling out of the top 200, forcing her to play a series of smaller tournaments to regain her standing. She entered this tournament ranked 43rd in the world, though few in tennis believed there were 42 women better than Muchova. But playing in a Grand Slam final for the first time is a challenge for any player, especially against the best in the world. Swiatek had cruised through her first five matches of the tournament. She won four of her first six sets without conceding a game. Then she lost just seven games across her next two matches. Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil made Swiatek uncomfortable for a bit in the semifinal, pushing her around the court and into a tiebreaker in the second set, but she arrived in the final with every reason to believe she would be lifting the trophy at day’s end. That faith grew stronger in the first minutes of the match, as the fluidity and mix of power and finesse that Muchova plays with on her best days were nowhere to be found. She sprayed balls wide and long, banged easy shots into the middle of the net, and gave Swiatek too many free points.",
            "negative21": "Świątek held her serve and then broke Muchová to win the first set.  Final: Swiatek 6-2 Świątek started the second set, maintaining the momentum she gained from the first. She held her serve and then broke Muchová to repeat the start of the first set with a 2-0 lead. She picked up the Game 3 win by holding serve, but Muchová finally got on the board by holding her own serve in Game 4 to make it 3-1. Muchová then broke Świątek for the first time in the match to push the score to 3-2. Things got all tied up as she continued this momentum to hold serve. Świątek picked up a Game 6 win with her serve, but Muchová held strong for hers pushing the set to a 4-4 tie. A costly double fault saw Muchová break Świątek for the second time this set, and she had her first game lead of the match. Świątek responded with a break of her own to even the set back at five games apiece. Muchová broke Świątek for the third time this set and took the 6-5 lead with a chance to win the set if she could hold serve. It took the game going to deuce, but Muchová came back and solidified the st victory to force a third set.",
            "negative22": "All of it was there Saturday on one of the sport’s biggest stages, in one of the great Grand Slam finals in recent memory. Swiatek, who had sprinted to a seemingly insurmountable lead, wobbled as Muchova found her form, then battled from a service break down twice in the deciding set and found the answers and shots she needed. Swiatek had never lost a Grand Slam final and won all of those matches in straight sets. One of the few lingering questions was how she would respond if pushed into the crucible of a third set with everything on the line. At first, it didn’t look good. She double-faulted to give Muchova yet another break of serve to start the deciding set and looked finished as Muchova surged to a 2-0 lead. Mary Carillo, the longtime tennis commentator, likes to divide players into two groups — those who have fangs and those who do not, those who don’t just win from the front but relish the chance to brawl and fight to the final ball and those who pack it in. Muchova had shown her fangs in the semifinal and in mounting her comeback on Saturday. Now it was Swiatek’s turn. She won 12 of the next 14 points to take back the lead only to watch Muchova bite once more, turning the third set into a roller coaster.",
            "negative23": "On a lighter note, she was also among the players this summer who led an outcry over the balls that women use at the U.S. Open, which are different from those that men play with. From the start, all the signs pointed to this being Swiatek’s afternoon. During the warm-up, the sound system blasted AC/DC, one of her favorite bands. (Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin also have a major presence on her playlist.) Once the balls started flying, Swiatek gave little reason for anyone to believe that this match would go any differently from so many finals before. Coming in, Swiatek had played in 10 career finals. She has not lost one since her first, way back in 2019. Even more remarkably, she has not lost a set in any of those wins. “Iga never loses finals, so it is going to be very tough,” Jabeur said Thursday night, as Swiatek staged her second comeback in this tournament from a set down in her semifinal battle against Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus, a player she was especially determined not to lose to for a variety of reasons. Against Jabeur on Saturday, Swiatek ambushed from the start. She won 12 of the first 14 points, sprinting to a 3-0 lead. Jabeur climbed back, getting back on serve as Swiatek momentarily lost control of her overpowering forehand.",
            "negative24": "“It’s New York, so loud, so crazy,” she would say later of both her past two weeks and this match. Just keeping the ball in play was no longer working. Jabeur was sending her back and forth across the baseline and held chances to break Swiatek’s serve in the next game and serve for the second set. And just then, Swiatek figured out how to calm her nerves and dial back the mistakes. It wasn’t pretty, but it solved the problem, or at least stopped too many more from happening. Jabeur would stretch Swiatek, getting as close as anyone has in a Grand Slam final to winning a set. But in the tiebreaker, strokes that had become smooth and steady started sailing. On their final point, Swiatek’s first serve was not even close, and she lobbed in her second ball. The forehand Swiatek hit off Jabeur’s return floated into the middle of the court, but Jabeur couldn’t take advantage of it, and the championship was hers.  There should be many, many more.  Matthew Futterman is a veteran sports journalist and the author of two books, “Running to the Edge: A Band of Misfits and the Guru Who Unlocked the Secrets of Speed” and “Players: How Sports Became a Business.",
            "negative25": "“Hopefully this is the beginning of so many things.” The second set followed a similar pattern to the first at the beginning, with Swiatek surging to a 3-0 lead, Jabeur getting back on serve, and then Swiatek, seizing control right back in the sixth game to get within two games of the championship From there, the only question was whether Swiatek’s occasionally shaky psyche might get the better of her or whether a crowd that swung to Jabeur’s side, begging her to extend the afternoon and make their high-price tickets worthwhile, might be able to rattle her. A few random knuckleheads started whistling in the middle of Swiatek’s service motion. A baby cried. Jabeur abandoned the cute stuff. No more variety for variety’s sake. She tried to match Swiatek’s power from the baseline. It worked as she evened the set at four games each. Swiatek is so different, though, from the fragile player who won her first Grand Slam title as a teenager. She has evolved from a player who cried in the bathroom during toilet breaks in the middle of matches into a problem solver. That player might never have had a prayer of prevailing in New York, where all the noise and commotion — passing trains and planes, fans who feel they have the right to long raucous matches and to help determine the outcome — make winning here such a different task from anywhere else.",
            "negative26": "She led 6-2, 3-0 after an hour, while Muchova was still trying to find her footing. “The balls are coming fast,” Muchova said of the experience of facing Swiatek. “If you have a chance you have to take it because there may not be another.” And then she did. Shot by shot, point-by-point, game-by-game, she did. The strokes grew crisp and precise, the points stretched out, she slid into her shots so gracefully at moments it looked like she was dancing. Her volleys stung as the packed crowd of more than 15,000 fans chanted her name, urging her on. Swiatek wobbled, and as the match moved to the two-hour mark it was all even at a set apiece. Two minutes later, Muchova broke Swiatek’s serve for a third straight time and had her first lead of the day. Muchova and Swiatek had not played a competitive match since 2019, before either of them had established themselves at the top of the game. But they have practiced many times since then, and Swiatek has raved about Muchova’s talents. “Great touch,” Swiatek said of her competitor. “She can also speed up the game. She plays with that kind of, I don’t know, freedom in her movements. And she has a great technique.",

Djokovic can become the top-ranked men's player in the world with a win over Ruud in the French Open men's final on Sunday.  Sunday's French Open final is the opportunity Djokovic has been waiting for. The Serbian can break a tie with Rafael Nadal for the most men's Grand Slam singles titles in history by claiming his 23rd major championship at Roland Garros on Sunday against Ruud. Djokovic can also become the first man to win every major—Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open—at least three times. Additionally, a French Open victory would put him one step closer to sweeping the major tournaments this year, having also defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Australian Open in January. Only two men have won all four Grand Slam titles in the same year—Don Budge in 1938 and Rod Laver, who accomplished the feat in 1962 and 1969. Djokovic previously won the French Open in 2016 and 2021. He has found the most success at the Australian Open, where he is a 10-time champion, and is considered one of the greatest hard-court players in the Open era with 13 hard-court major titles.",
            "negative29": "Had Alcaraz not dealt with cramping in his leg on Friday, it's worth wondering whether he would have given Djokovic a better run for his money. The Spaniard is widely believed to be the next big thing in men's tennis, and he already has one Grand Slam title to his name as a 20-year-old, winning the 2022 U.S. Open by defeating Ruud. Alcaraz won the U.S. Open when he was just 19 years old, becoming the first male player to win a Grand Slam as a teenager since Nadal accomplished the feat at Roland Garros in 2005. Additionally, Alcaraz has won 10 ATP Tour men's singles titles, which includes the 2022 U.S. Open and four Masters 1000 titles. Two of his Masters 1000 titles came in the Madrid Open, while the others came in the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and the Miami Open. Alcaraz, who turned pro in 2018, is only just getting started, and tennis fans around the globe are in for a treat once he hits his prime.

Ruud, though, again hangs in there, making advantage and closing out with an ace. “As a Federer fan through and through,” writes Yogesh P, “I’m reluctantly on board with the fact that he does not have the best shout at being the GOAT. The arguments for Djokovic are straightforward. The argument for Nadal is also quite compelling though. If there is one achievement of these big three that is least likely to be repeated in the future, it is Nadal’s dominance of clay. Even the Grand Slam total can arguably be overcome in a weak competitive environment.” Yes, and Nadal is better on clay than anyone else has been on any one surface – not something I thought I’d ever say when watching Sampras on grass – but I don’t think that’s a good metric because there are other surfaces.",

Playing in his seventh French Open final, Djokovic stepped onto the clay court on the cusp of winning a third Roland-Garros title and a record-setting 23rd men's Grand Slam crown. Djokovic’s tenacious temperament was on full display, winning a bruising 81-minute opening set. While Ruud dictated the opening salvos taking a 4-1 lead, Djokovic clawed his way back to enforce the tiebreak. Djokovic would have rubbed his hands with glee, knowing the tiebreak has been his bread and butter at this year’s tournament. The Serb has won all his tiebreaks during the tournament without making a single unforced error. He kept that record intact to claim the first set with relative ease, giving him the shot in the arm he needed after a relatively slow start to the match. With the wind at his back, Djokovic got into his usual rhythm and broke early for a 3-0 lead in the second set. Ruud put up some resistance, but Djokovic purred along to claim the second with a record 23rd Grand Slam within reach. But Ruud refused to give Djokovic a free pass into the record books and held his serve until the Serbian stole his serve in the 11th game before holding his serve to clinch No 23.",
            "negative36": "Attention now turns to the grass court season with Wimbledon, the next Grand Slam of 2023, just weeks away staring on 3 July.

He does well to retort with an ace, though, only his second of the match, and closes out from there. “Essentially, it’s a perishingly fine line between greatest and favourite,” reckons Matt Dony. “A compelling case could probably be made for Federer, Nadal or Djokovic to be the greatest player, but it almost doesn’t matter. The three of them have all obliterated records, destroyed all-comers, and set new standards. I will always love Federer, and I want him to be the greatest. But can I prove objectively by watertight metrics that he was ‘better’ than the other two? No. And likewise for the fans of the other two. The important thing is, between them, they’ve brought joy to pretty much ALL tennis fans. We can, however, definitely agree on specific strengths that they all enjoy. Now, any elite sportsperson has mental strength, but I can’t think of many individuals in any sport who have shown greater focus, determination, cold-blooded will-to-win than Djokovic. I don’t particularly like him (for a great number of reasons) but I espect the hell out of him.",

Any talk that he’s been unfortunate to fall between generations is nonsense. He has a losing record to Joker, hasn’t beaten him on grass in over a decade, and hasn’t taken a single set off him on a hard court since the 2013 US Open.

It just feels that when it comes to it, they’ll always face a better player able to take advantage of their relatively weak backhands, though I guess Berrettini at least has that serve. Anyhow, another easy hold for Djokovic, who looks impregnable currently. “Allow me a word for Andy Murray, please,” offers Simon McMahon. “For him to even be mentioned in the same breath as Federer, Djokovic and Nadal is testament to his greatness, I’d argue. Maybe not statistically (though he’s about to win again on grass in the UK), but as you rightly point out, it’s not all about simply doing the math. Greatness can be measured in many ways. If I could have one sporting wish for this year, it’s that Murray somehow makes the Wimbledon final…” I love Murray, and his three majors are worth more than, say, Jim Courier’s four, and you can’t beat sportsfolk who stand for things, especially when those things are decency and integrity.",

While Roger Federer and Nadal have broken down with injuries, Djokovic is going strong, missing time over the past few years only due to his personal choice to remain unvaccinated against COVID-19. Brady wasn't the only star to witness Djokovic extend his legacy Sunday. Footballer Kylian Mbappé and the recently retired Zlatan Ibrahimović were in the crowd. Heavyweight boxing legend Mike Tyson was also in attendance. While Djokovic now has the men's record for Grand Slam title wins, Nadal has won the French Open championship a record 14 times. He missed the tournament this year after an injury from the Australian Open required surgery. Although Djokovic made it clear that he viewed Nadal's absence as an opportunity to win, joking that he didn't miss him, the Spanish great offered Djokovic congratulations via Twitter. It’s narratively satisfying when younger players battle and win over the previous generation. It signals a changing of the guard and the forward flow of time. But Djokovic isn’t on board. \"I really wish you all the best. I wish you to win against anyone except me,\" he told Ruud before accepting La Coupe des Mousquetaires. \"If I lose early in a Grand Slam, you can win it, no problem.",

Ruud is struggling to land first serves now and he doesn’t here, but he does get to deuce. So Djokovic finds another fine return then directs his man to hither and yon before cleaning up, and a sliced backhand yanks Ruud to the net, a lob forces him away from it, and a drop is too good.

In a breathtaking, up-and-down battle, Muchova fell just short as Swiatek triumphed 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 on one of tennis’s grandest stages. When Muchova’s second serve tumbled into the net on match point, the two shared a heartfelt moment at the net, with Muchova offering a well-earned congratulatory hug. As the runner-up of the tournament of 2023 French Open women’s singles, Muchova received her trophy amidst an emotional scene. Fighting back tears, she acknowledged the crowd and expressed her gratitude: “This is incredible. Thank you, everyone … This was so close, but so far. This is what happens when you play one of the best.” Seven-time French Open champion Chris Evert, greeted by thunderous applause, presented the trophies during the ceremony.

With Saturday’s win, she captured her third French Open singles title in four years. Since 2019, her record in the tournament heading into the final was 28-2, which may not rival the 112-3 record of Rafael Nadal, but give her time. Swiatek just turned 22 last week and has given few hints that she will be slowing down. Other than the occasional battle with her psyche, she seems to be getting better each year, especially at the French Open, a tournament she loves more than any other. For Muchova, the final capped a remarkable comeback from a year ago, when she sprained an ankle in a third-round singles match at Roland Garros and had to withdraw.

Double champs also get their very own trophies: The Jacques-Brugnon Cup for the winning men’s duo and the Simonne-Mathieu Cup for the women’s doubles champions. And while there are slight increases in pay in each round, the bulk of the purse increase appears to reward players who exit earlier in the tournament — players who lose in the first three rounds are expected to receive between 11% and 13% more. Additionally, competitors who participate in qualifying, wheelchair tennis, and quad competitions, will also make more money this year.

Muchova’s lead lasted seven minutes, until an ill-timed drop shot settled to the bottom of the net and Swiatek was even once more and hearing the deafening chants of her name to the beat of a bass drum. “Iga is No. 1 in the world and I was so close,” Muchova said. With Muchova serving to stay in the match, Swiatek took dead aim on her returns at Muchova’s feet and nailed her targets, putting Muchova on her heels and in a quick hole. Double match point arrived as Muchova pulled a forehand wide. With a double-fault from Muchova, Swiatek had her crown, the queen of clay for another year. “Sorry for being so difficult,” she told her team during the awards ceremony. Four Grand Slam finals.

She entered this tournament ranked 43rd in the world, though few in tennis believed there were 42 women better than Muchova. But playing in a Grand Slam final for the first time is a challenge for any player, especially against the best in the world. Swiatek had cruised through her first five matches of the tournament. She won four of her first six sets without conceding a game. Then she lost just seven games across her next two matches. Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil made Swiatek uncomfortable for a bit in the semifinal, pushing her around the court and into a tiebreaker in the second set, but she arrived in the final with every reason to believe she would be lifting the trophy at day’s end. That faith grew stronger in the first minutes of the match, as the fluidity and mix of power and finesse that Muchova plays with on her best days were nowhere to be found. She sprayed balls wide and long, banged easy shots into the middle of the net, and gave Swiatek too many free points.",

Unlike Naomi Osaka two years prior, Sabalenka was not fined and was allowed to do her next interviews with just a WTA employee.[8][9]  During the trophy presentation, Ivan Dodig, a four-time Roland Garros champion, expressed his disappointment with the French Open organizers, stating that he was not treated like every athlete should be. Dodig claimed that he had traveled by taxi for 15 days, often experiencing delays and feeling like a tourist in Paris. He emphasized the importance of treating all players equally in order to maintain fair competition. In response to Dodig's criticism, tournament director Amelie Mauresmo considered his language \"unacceptable\" and sought to clarify the situation. Mauresmo pointed out that there were numerous hotels within a three-mile radius of the venue and that any player could book transportation within a five-kilometer range. She mentioned that Dodig had chosen a hotel in a different part of Paris, far from the tournament site, but alternative options were offered to him. However, Mauresmo explained that the organizers aimed to prioritize environmental sustainability and had limited resources, including a conscious approach to transportation.[10]",

Swiatek, who had sprinted to a seemingly insurmountable lead, wobbled as Muchova found her form, then battled from a service break down twice in the deciding set and found the answers and shots she needed. Swiatek had never lost a Grand Slam final and won all of those matches in straight sets. One of the few lingering questions was how she would respond if pushed into the crucible of a third set with everything on the line. At first, it didn’t look good. She double-faulted to give Muchova yet another break of serve to start the deciding set and looked finished as Muchova surged to a 2-0 lead. Mary Carillo, the longtime tennis commentator, likes to divide players into two groups — those who have fangs and those who do not, those who don’t just win from the front but relish the chance to brawl and fight to the final ball and those who pack it in. Muchova had shown her fangs in the semifinal and in mounting her comeback on Saturday. Now it was Swiatek’s turn. She won 12 of the next 14 points to take back the lead only to watch Muchova bite once more, turning the third set into a roller coaster.",

Ruud, though, again hangs in there, making advantage and closing out with an ace. “As a Federer fan through and through,” writes Yogesh P, “I’m reluctantly on board with the fact that he does not have the best shout at being the GOAT. The arguments for Djokovic are straightforward. The argument for Nadal is also quite compelling though. If there is one achievement of these big three that is least likely to be repeated in the future, it is Nadal’s dominance of clay. Even the Grand Slam total can arguably be overcome in a weak competitive environment.” Yes, and Nadal is better on clay than anyone else has been on any one surface – not something I thought I’d ever say when watching Sampras on grass – but I don’t think that’s a good metric because there are other surfaces.",

Any talk that he’s been unfortunate to fall between generations is nonsense. He has a losing record to Joker, hasn’t beaten him on grass in over a decade, and hasn’t taken a single set off him on a hard court since the 2013 US Open.

It just feels that when it comes to it, they’ll always face a better player able to take advantage of their relatively weak backhands, though I guess Berrettini at least has that serve. Anyhow, another easy hold for Djokovic, who looks impregnable currently. “Allow me a word for Andy Murray, please,” offers Simon McMahon. “For him to even be mentioned in the same breath as Federer, Djokovic and Nadal is testament to his greatness, I’d argue. Maybe not statistically (though he’s about to win again on grass in the UK), but as you rightly point out, it’s not all about simply doing the math. Greatness can be measured in many ways. If I could have one sporting wish for this year, it’s that Murray somehow makes the Wimbledon final…” I love Murray, and his three majors are worth more than, say, Jim Courier’s four, and you can’t beat sportsfolk who stand for things, especially when those things are decency and integrity.",

And, well, expletive! another sensational forehand – he’s hitting these so, so well at the moment – howls from centre to sideline, and after acknowledging the crowd he punishes a backhand down the line for a love break, and that was a perfect game, a shocking exhibition of power and control, skill and thinking. I simply cannot believe how good he is and nor can you. In 90 seconds, Novak Djokovic will serve for his third French Open and 23rd Grand Slam singles title. History has its eyes on him! *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 5-5 Ruud You’ve just got to laugh. An ace, Djokovic’s 10th, begins the game, then a backhand slice falls wide for 30-0.

Djokovic already has spent more weeks at the top spot than any player — man or woman — since the inception of computerized tennis rankings a half-century ago. It was Djokovic who eliminated Alcaraz in the semifinals on Thursday, wearing him down over two thrilling sets until the 20-year-old Spaniard's body cramped up badly. Alcaraz continued to play, but the scores of the last two sets of the four-set match told the story: 6-1, 6-1. This was the third Slam final in the past five events for Ruud, a 24-year-old from Norway, but he is now 0-3. He lost to Nadal at the French Open a year ago and to Alcaraz at the U.S. Open last September. Perhaps due to an awareness of all that was at stake, Djokovic, in his 34th major final, was the one who got off to a shaky start. Ruud emerged to a partial ovation and polite applause.",

He does well to retort with an ace, though, only his second of the match, and closes out from there. “Essentially, it’s a perishingly fine line between greatest and favourite,” reckons Matt Dony. “A compelling case could probably be made for Federer, Nadal or Djokovic to be the greatest player, but it almost doesn’t matter. The three of them have all obliterated records, destroyed all-comers, and set new standards. I will always love Federer, and I want him to be the greatest. But can I prove objectively by watertight metrics that he was ‘better’ than the other two? No. And likewise for the fans of the other two. The important thing is, between them, they’ve brought joy to pretty much ALL tennis fans. We can, however, definitely agree on specific strengths that they all enjoy. Now, any elite sportsperson has mental strength, but I can’t think of many individuals in any sport who have shown greater focus, determination, cold-blooded will-to-win than Djokovic. I don’t particularly like him (for a great number of reasons) but I espect the hell out of him.",
            "negative38": "Djokovic came close to pulling off that feat in 2021, when he won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon and made it all the way to the title match at the U.S. Open before losing to Daniil Medvedev. Djokovic will resume that pursuit at Wimbledon, which begins on the grass of the All England Club on July 3. He has now clutched the trophy at 11 of the last 20 Slams, a remarkable run made even more so when considering that he did not participate in two majors during that span because he did not get vaccinated against COVID-19. Djokovic was deported from Australia in January 2021 before the Australian Open, and he was not allowed to fly to the United States ahead of last year's U.S. Open under a rule that since has been lifted. Getting to 23 not only sets the mark for men, but it also lets Djokovic equal Serena Williams, who wrapped up her career last year, for the most by anyone in the Open era, which began in 1968. Margaret Court won some of her all-time record of 24 Slam trophies in the amateur era. At 20 days past his 36th birthday, Djokovic is the oldest singles champion at Roland Garros, considered the most grueling of the majors because of the lengthy, grinding points required by the red clay, which is slower than the grass or hard courts underfoot elsewhere.",
            "negative39": "Djokovic 7-6(1) 2-0 Ruud* Trouble for Ruud who finds himself down 0-30 – Djokovic is starting to hum – and though a forehand into the corner halves the arrears, a fine forehand returns raises two break points. And Ruud saves both, Djokovic getting really close on the second with a forehand that’s fractionally wide … only for the Serb to finally nail an overhead – set up by another decent return – that gives him advantage. Ruud is struggling to land first serves now and he doesn’t here, but he does get to deuce. So Djokovic finds another fine return then directs his man to hither and yon before cleaning up, and a sliced backhand yanks Ruud to the net, a lob forces him away from it, and a drop is too good. That’s the break and this match is only going one way. “At risk of prolonging an endless and futile argument,” begins Bruce Millar, “Roger Federer is clearly the GOAT, for two reasons: 1. There is nothing to choose between F/N/D on overall stats, with 82/3% pro wins. But Fed has won significantly more Wimbledons and US Opens that the others (go and count them).",
            "negative40": "Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 3-4 Ruud* Ruud punishes a backhand winner down the line then lands an ace on the T, the umpire overruling an out-call. Then, at 40-30, he pounds a forehand to the corner then cleans up with an overhead, and he’s fighting well to stick in this match. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 3-3 Ruud Djokovic has yet to drop a point on serve in this set and at 15-0 he lands another ace on the T, then a service winner makes 40-15 and from there the game is quickly ended. Here comes the next breaking opportunity… “The H2H thing,”” begins Gregory Phillips. “Not as fair a comparison as it might seem at first glance, since the peaks of Federer and Djokovic in particular didn’t align. It’s also the presence of the other two that also served to make this era what it is. With no Nadal, for example, Federer would likely have half a dozen more slams. I don’t think there’s a way to separate them, but if Djokovic was more likeable I doubt as many people would be disputing his GOAT status.",
            "negative41": "Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 6-5 Ruud* Djokovic shanks a forehand – yes, you read that correctly, how absolutely date he, pathetic – then pauses for quiet before serving at 40-15.

A freak of nature, physically and mentally, and he is not close to finished yet! *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 6-5 Ruud Ruud goes long on the forehand for 15-0, then nets a return for 30. Djokovic has made and is making this look so routine, winning 10 points on the spin and zetzing a serve down the middle that sets up a yet another booming forehand. Three championship points, three points to go out alone on 23 majors. What on earth are we seeing, people? I’ve not the foggiest but please, drink it in, because whatever it is, it’s never happening again.",
            "negative42": "Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 4-5 Ruud* Out of nowhere, Djokovic annihilates a forehand from centre that breaks the sideline – it’s ridiculous – but then he nets a drop and Ruud clouts a a winner from mid-court. But a mishit then sails long for 30-all and the pressure ratchets up only for a forehand to go long before a backhand zips fractionally wide. Djokovic will now serve to stay in the set. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 4-4 Ruud Ruud’s struggled to make any impression on the Djokovic serve since set one, but the Serb nets a volley then a forehand and is something happening here? Er, probably not, a net-cord sending the ball clambering over it then an ace down the middle levelling things and another, right onto the T, securing the hold. Djokovic raises an arm to salute the crowd –well, to salute himself really – and you can’ say he hasn’t earned the right. If he can break next up, he’ll be serving for the championship and the record.",
            "negative43": "Even when he’s a set or two down, you never expect him to lose. It’s astonishing. He’ll probably win today, and he deserves to. He is, inarguably, one of the greatest. Not just tennis players. One of the greatest competitors. One of the greatest sportspeople.” *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 Ruud Ruud goes long for 15-0 then Djokovic conjures a lovely angle to go from backhand corner to sideline, via forehand; he’s two points away. Another decent forehand then entices Ruud to slice into the net, and when a return drops short, a backhand down the line seals the set. Novak Djokovic is a set away from becoming the most successful singles player in the men’s game. He’s good at tennis, I reckon. Djokovic 7-6(1) 5-3 Ruud* Djokovic whooshes a forehand onto the line and Ruud can retort, netting then clumping wide from mid-court with plenty of space to hit. That’a dreadful shot at a dreadful moment, and another terrific return helps bring about another error; two set points. Ruud, though, saves both, the second with a fantastic leaping forehand winner that breaks the sideline, rishes through deuce and Djokovic will have to serve for it. I fear he shall cope.",

The tournament consisted of men's (singles and doubles), women's (singles and doubles), mixed doubles, boys' (under 18 – singles and doubles, under 14 – singles), girls' (under 18 – singles and doubles, under 14 – singles), which were a part of the Grade A category of tournaments for under 18, and singles & doubles events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players. This edition marked the return of the gentlemen's and ladies' invitational doubles competitions for the first time since 2019, along with the introduction of a new mixed invitational doubles draw.[citation needed]  This was the tournament's first edition with a scheduled order of play on the first Sunday during the event, dubbed \"Middle Sunday\". Prior to the 2022 edition, the tournament had seen only four exceptions to the tradition of withholding competition on Middle Sunday to accommodate delayed matches during championships that were heavily disrupted by rain.[6] Additionally, this was the first edition of the tournament to have a champions tie break rule in the final set.",

Martina Navratilova is the most successful women's singles player in Wimbledon history, with six of her nine titles coming in consecutive years between 1982 and 1987. Serena Williams is closest to Navratilova's astonishing total among modern players, amassing seven titles across 14 years. Now 41, it is unlikely Williams will return to Wimbledon, although she is yet to retire officially and could be tempted back into action because she is one grand slam win away from Margaret Court's record of 24 major trophies. Navratilova and Williams' fellow American, Helen Wills Moody, won Wimbledon eight times during the pre-Open Era, and Briton Dorothea Lambert Chambers triumphed seven times between 1903 and 1914. Switzerland's Martina Hingis is the youngest player to win Wimbledon in the Open Era, doing so as a 16-year-old in 1997. Before then, home player Lottie Dod won as a 15-year-old in 1887. Dod is said to have been listening to Wimbledon on the radio when she died 73 years later. Boris Becker holds the men's record, winning as a 17-year-old in 1985.",

And under the scorching London sun, with not a cloud in sight, it didn’t disappoint.            Despite playing in his first grand slam final, Kyrgios – who qualified for the final after Nadal pulled out due to injury – showed absolutely no signs of being overawed. Facing the world No. 3, his powerful serve was booming from the start.            The pair exchanged rallies at a rapid pace, with both showing supreme accuracy and skill to keep each other on their toes.            Midway through the opening set, Kyrgios made the first big break.

Kyrgios unique style of play, including his occasional chuntering to his box, has won over the watching crowds and it was the same for the final, with the 27-year-old receiving much of the backing.            However, in the second set, Djokovic slowly but steadily found his feet.            He managed to extended the rallies, using his dexterity and resilience to remain in the game and eventually wear Kyrgios.            And in the fourth game of the set, he broke Kyrgios to take a two-game lead – the first time he’s broke the Australian in their three meetings.            Kyrgios fought to remain in the set, earning three break points as Djokovic served to level the sets. But, despite some complaining in the direction of his box, he was unable to convert any of those, as Djokovic returned the game to parity.            The third set was the most even so far.

This was also her third loss in a major final.           But that is what pressure does to a player, especially one carrying the hopes of not only a nation but a continent while also trying to grapple with her own expectations, dreams and past failures. Jabeur again came close to becoming the first Arab and African woman to win a grand slam, but her 31 unforced errors proved costly and the wait goes on. That she won just four of 10 break points will likely play heavy on her mind for some time, too.",

I think it was the most impossible Grand Slam for me to win, so I didn’t even think of it. When we came, I was just like, ‘Try to win a couple of matches.’ Now this happened. It’s crazy.” After being sidelined from April to October, she finished last season ranked just 99th. She was 42nd when she arrived at Wimbledon and was the first unseeded woman to even reach the final at the All England Club in 60 years — the last, 1963 runner-up Billie Jean King, was seated in the front row of the Royal Box on Saturday alongside Kate, the Princess of Wales. Following the match, King greeted Vondrousova with a hug and told her: “First unseeded ever. I love it.” Centre Court’s retractable roof was closed for the final, shielding everyone from the wind that topped 20 mph (30 kph) outside, and that allowed Vondrousova’s smooth strokes to repeatedly find the intended mark.",

The 28-year-old from Tunisia is the only Arab woman and only North African woman to make it that far in singles at any Grand Slam tournament. “You cannot force things,” the sixth-seeded Jabeur said. “It wasn’t meant to be.” She lost to Elena Rybakina 12 months ago at the All England Club and to No. 1 Iga Swiatek at the U.S. Open last September. “I think this is the most painful loss of my career,” Jabeur said Saturday, pausing to wipe away tears. Vondrousova’s surge to her Slam title was hard to envision at the start of this fortnight.

I think we are going to go tomorrow!\" Vondrousova is the fourth Czech - after Martina Navratilova, Jana Novotna and Petra Kvitova - to win the Wimbledon women's singles title. After holding serve without too many issues in the opening game, Jabeur converted her second break point to take a 2-0 lead with the Centre Court roof closed due to high winds. But the sixth seed from Tunisia appeared to struggle with the lack of pace on shots coming from the other side of the net, certainly compared to reigning champion Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka who she had beaten in her previous two matches. A nervy-looking Vondrousova broke back for 1-2 before a lengthy fourth game, with both players showing their subtlety and variation, which eventually yielded the Czech's first service hold of the match.

Statistics she would come to regret as Vondroušová took control.           The finalists traded breaks in the second and third games of the match, drawing level at 2-2 after a series of absorbing, lengthy baseline battles. More breaks followed – four in the opening seven games – as nerves infiltrated their play, adding to the tension.           Vondroušová, the unpredictable left-handed underdog varied her tactics brilliantly. She kept changing the pace and spin on the ball and eventually took the first set, securing the crucial break in the ninth game to serve out the set.           The 28-year-old Jabeur was left shaking her head as she was broken in the opening game of the second set, her opponent rattling off six games in a row to put herself in the ascendancy.

Vondrousova held to love to take the first set 6-4 with Jabeur winning just one point in the last four games. After taking a toilet break, Jabeur put an easy backhand volley into the net and sent a down-the-line backhand wide prompting the crowd to voice their encouragement. They were vocal again when another unforced error set up another break point, and a forehand into the net handed Vondrousova the early initiative in the second set. The errors continued to flow thick and fast from Jabeur's racket as Vondrousova moved quickly to 40-0. But then an acute backhand cross-court winner got her and the crowd going, and she eventually broke to level at 1-1. Then it was the left-hander's turn to falter in a topsy-turvy set where both players showed mere flashes of their best form. But Jabeur, from 3-1 up, again lost her way with Vondrousova levelling at 3-3 before breaking again for a 5-4 lead and a chance to serve for the match.",

One she went ahead in each, the crowd’s support for the popular Jabeur, nicknamed the Minister of Happiness for her demeanor on and off the court, would only rise, applause and shouts ricocheting off the cover atop the arena. Staying steady down the stretch, Vondrousova broke to lead 5-4 and served for the match. She was soon up 40-love — and that’s when the enormity of the moment hit her. “I couldn’t breathe,” Vondrousova said. “I just was thinking to myself: ‘Just be over.’” When she ended the match by reaching to put away a volley, she tumbled to the grass, then laid on her back and put her hands over her visor and face, the happiest she’s ever been on the surface.

Ah, but Alcaraz, last year’s U.S. Open champ, wanted this shot at Djokovic, someone he called “a legend of our sport.” Said it would make winning Wimbledon that much more special. And so Alcaraz managed to come through in that tiebreaker as choruses of “Car-los! Car-los!” from the stands competed with cries of his older, more experienced, more accomplished foe’s two-syllable nickname, “No-le! No-le!” And then Alcaraz came through in a 32-point, 25-minute masterpiece of a game soon thereafter. And, crucially, the Spaniard came through in the crucible of a fifth set, too. Add it all up, and the No. 1-ranked Alcaraz marked himself as the star people have been predicting he would be, transforming potential into triumph and putting an end to Djokovic’s 34-match winning streak at the All England Club all in one fell swoop by edging him 1-6, 7-6 (6), 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 in an engaging, back-and-forth final on Sunday. Alcaraz claimed his first title at Wimbledon and second Grand Slam trophy overall.",

I daresay Djokovic now regrets that double-break game, and when Alcaraz annihilates a forehand winner he’s left flat on his face like a lizard drinking. Two break points, and if one is taken, it’ll be impossible to see a way back even for this obscene specimen of physiological perfection … but a backhand winner down the line saves the first and a long forehand the second. Deuce, and I’m wincing at the prospect so can’t begin to contemplate the evilness of the flashbacks Djokovic is experiencing, but a tremendous stretch-volley makes advantage and a big serve secures a hold of Ade Akinfenwa proportions. “I’ve been going to Wimbledon for over 60 years, I’m from Wimbledon, and I worked at the Championships during student days,” says Rob Lewis, “and I don’t remember such a long game - 32 points! Is that a record? I felt for your fingers, typing about it. Never mind the players, how could they withstand that pressure for so long?",
            "negative27": "“Didn’t get down, didn’t give up,” said Alcaraz, the third-youngest man to win the grass-court major in the Open era, which began in 1968, after Boris Becker and Bjorn Borg. “We made great rallies, great points. It was a long, long match. Long sets. It was the mental part that allowed me to stay there.” He is the first man outside the elite quartet of Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray to win Wimbledon since 2002 and, to many, this symbolized a transfer of power in men’s tennis. “I haven’t played a player like him. Ever,” said Djokovic, quite a statement from a guy who competed against Federer and Nadal for so long and in so many remarkable matches. “He’s proven,” Djokovic said, “that he’s the best player in the world, no doubt.” The age gap between Alcaraz and the 36-year-old Djokovic, who wiped away tears during the trophy ceremony, was the widest in any men’s Slam final since 1974. So Alcaraz had youth on his side, which he also did, of course, when they met in the French Open semifinals last month. That one was extraordinary for two sets before Alcaraz cramped up and faded.",
            "negative28": "As people in the stands rose to roar, Alcaraz spun around with his right hand to his ear, soaking in the moment. “If I would have lost that set, probably I couldn’t lift the trophy,” Alcaraz said. “I probably could have lost in three sets.” They were two hours and two sets in. One set each. Now it was a match. It began to feel memorable. The fifth game of the third set might have been worth the high price of admission, in and of itself. Neither man wanted to bend. Neither wanted to cede a thing. It was one game, yes, but seemed meaningful. When Djokovic slapped a forehand into the net to get broken — one of five times he dropped serve in the match, more than his previous six opponents managed combined — Alcaraz celebrated his 4-1 edge in the set by throwing his head back and screaming “Vamos!” But Djokovic did not go away. He raised his level again, pushing this terrific tussle to a fifth set. One of several reasons to like Djokovic’s chances at that juncture: He went into Sunday with a 10-1 record in five-setters at Wimbledon and 35-9 at all majors. Those matches, however, were in the past. Alcaraz is the future. His serves top 130 mph.",

Alcaraz dropped the second set and faced a pair of set points while down 6-5 in the third. But he erased each of those point-from-the-set opportunities for Ruud with the sorts of quick-reflex, soft-hand volleys he repeatedly displayed. And with help from a series of shanked shots by a tight-looking Ruud in the ensuing tiebreaker, Alcaraz surged to the end of that set. One break in the fourth was all it took for Alcaraz to seal the victory in the only Grand Slam final between two players seeking both a first major championship and the top spot in the ATP's computerized rankings, which date to 1973. Ruud is a 23-year-old from Norway who is now 0-2 in Slam finals. He was the runner-up to Rafael Nadal at the French Open in June. Ruud stood way back near the wall to return serve, but also during the course of points, much more so than Alcaraz, who attacked when he could. Alcaraz went after Ruud's weaker side, the backhand, and found success that way, especially while serving.

Years from now, the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Anna Wintour, Questlove and Christie Brinkley can tell friends they were there when the teenager won his first Grand Slam title. The championship came at the end of an epic week for Alcaraz. Just to get to the final, he played three straight five-set matches, starting Monday, that had him on the court for some 15 hours. His quarterfinal victory over Jannik Sinner, during which he was one point from elimination, lasted until 2:50 a.m. on Thursday, the latest finish in the history of a tournament notorious for late endings. Two nights later, or rather, the next night, he outlasted Tiafoe in emotional, battle-filled, lung-busting rallies in a match with miraculous point-saving shots to the end. “I’ve never played a player who moves as well,” said Tiafoe, who has played the best of the best. “He’s going to be a problem for a very long time.” Alcaraz, though, said his first chance at a Grand Slam final was no time to be tired, and he started causing problems for Ruud early.",
            "negative12": "This was a different Ruud than the one who took a drubbing from Nadal in his first Grand Slam final at the French Open three months ago, on a day when he looked like someone with really good seats for the match rather than an opponent. Ruud was not going away on his own Sunday. But throughout the tournament, Alcaraz showed a rare ability to find the next gear to meet whatever challenge came his way. He put that on full display late in the third set, during a crucial, and for Ruud, soul-crushing stretch across a single game and a tiebreaker. With Alcaraz serving to stay in the set, Ruud poured every bit of his power and determination into a series of rocketed forehands that earned him two chances to move a set ahead. Each time, Alcaraz pressed forward, fearlessly pushing into the court chin first. His chance for a lead gone, Ruud crumpled in the tiebreaker with a series of wild misses as Alcaraz reeled off seven consecutive points. From there, holding back Alcaraz suddenly felt much like it has all year, a task akin to holding back an ocean. An absurd forehand, topspin lob while Alcaraz was running at full speed gave him the chance to get the crucial fourth-set service break. A point later, he did his best impression of a human backboard until Ruud could keep the ball in the court no longer.",
            "negative13": "“Hard to believe he’s only teenager, but, yeah, he is,” Ruud said later.  After the final point, a crushing service winner, Alcaraz collapsed on his back. A minute later he was embracing his longtime coach — the former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero — who has piloted the journey, along with Alcaraz’s father, a former pro himself, and his grandfather, who helped develop the tennis club where he started to play as a 3-year-old. When he made it back to his chair, Alcaraz put his face in a towel and sobbed, as Ruud sat stoically a few feet away. Ruud knew what had hit him, and knew that it could be the first of many days that end like this one.  A little while later, Ferrero said Alcaraz had reached about 60 percent of his potential.  “I want to be on top for many weeks, many years,” Alcaraz said later in a news conference. Then he pointed at the trophy. “I want more of these.” The era is just starting.

            "negative14": "Determined not to get into another marathon slugfest against an opponent as steady and as fit as anyone else in the field, Alcaraz stepped on the gas pedal from the start, rushing the net at every good chance and ending points with crisp volleys hit on the sharpest angles. Given what had transpired recently, Ruud had every right to expect Alcaraz’s unique style of tennis attrition. Instead he got shock-and-awe. Alcaraz grabbed the early edge in the third game. With Ruud serving, he eschewed any inclinations to ease his way into the match. With a chance to cause early damage, Alcaraz flicked on his afterburners and started grunting with late-match urgency and volume on every shot. After Alcaraz clinched that first service break, Ruud grabbed his towel near the corner of the court where his father and coach, the former pro Christian Ruud, sat a few feet above the court. Team Ruud needed a plan B. It took another 10 games for Ruud to find it, but he did. Down a set, Ruud pressured Alcaraz by putting ball after ball at his feet, then put on an Alcaraz-like display of power and touch and covered the court to even the match after an hour and a half, as Alcaraz’s efficiency, and his lethal drop-shot, went missing temporarily.",
            "negative15": "It came while he was trailing 4-3 in the first set; he raced forward to a short ball that bounced twice before Ruud's racket touched it. Play continued, and Alcaraz hesitated then flubbed his response. But Ruud told the chair umpire what had happened, giving the point to Alcaraz, who gave his foe a thumbs-up and applauded right along with the spectators to acknowledge the move. Alcaraz certainly seems to be a rare talent, possessing an enviable all-court game, a blend of groundstroke power with a willingness to push forward and close points with his volleying ability. He won 34 of 45 points when he went to the net Sunday. He is a threat while serving — he delivered 14 aces at up to 128 mph on Sunday -- and returning, earning 11 break points, converting three. Make no mistake: Ruud is no slouch, either. There's a reason he is the youngest man since Nadal to get to two major finals in one season and managed to win a 55-shot point, the longest of the tournament, in the semifinals Friday. But this was Alcaraz's time to shine, his turn to show off the speed and stamina, the skill and sangfroid, of a champion.",

If she's fully recovered, then she'll carry her form from Toronto into the US Open, and following the draw, she should be able to ease herself back in over the opening three rounds. A potential match-up with Gauff in the fourth round would be a box-office match. Then she could face Maria Sakkari in the quarters, but Halep is in form, and I feel could go all the way. Bill Connelly: The women's game has been wide open in recent years, and we're getting used to heading into a Slam knowing that, at any given time, 15-20 players have the game to make a big run. (And as last year's US Open showed us, we don't even know the names of all of those 15-20 in advance.) But this might be the most wide-open Slam I can remember. So many of the names we were growing to trust the most have hit some bumps in the summer hardcourt tour -- Swiatek, Ons Jabeur, Paula Badosa and Sakkari lost 11 of 18 matches between them -- and the once-dominant Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams lost five of seven.

Ohm Youngmisuk: As last year's all-teen sensation final between Emma Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez showed, anyone can get hot and come out of the women's side, no matter how young or inexperienced. There are plenty of contenders, but something tells me to go with experience this Open. That is why I am leaning toward Halep. She recently returned to the top 10 for the first time in a year following her win in Toronto. She hasn't made it to the US Open final before and hasn't made the quarters here since 2016. But she should enter with confidence after Toronto and her semifinal showing at Wimbledon. Halep may have to go through Gauff and Sakkari to get to a possible semifinal showdown with either Kontaveit or Jabeur. Tough road to the final but nothing impossible. Jensen: I'm rockin' with American Taylor Fritz. A winner in Indian Wells earlier this spring and a great run to the quarters of Wimbledon, Taylor has the eye of the tiger right now. Confidence is mission critical when walking on these big stages, and if Fritz serves effectively he can hold the Tiffany trophy at the end.",

D'Arcy Maine: This draw feels so wide open, it's hard to feel confident with a prediction here. There's as good a chance as any for someone under the radar to take home the title, but for now, I'll play it slightly safe and agree with Tom and Bill. Halep's run in Toronto was impressive, against a slew of quality opponents. She has already won the 2018 French Open and Wimbledon in 2019, so if she's able to stay healthy, she certainly could complete the elusive career Surface Slam in New York. Aishwarya Kumar: She's had a little bit of a rough patch since Wimbledon, but I'm still going to go with Jabeur. She made it to the final of Wimbledon, becoming the first African or Arab player to reach the final of a Grand Slam in the Open era. She earned her career-high ranking of No. 2 in June after winning the Madrid Open. Her game is versatile -- she slices, she serves big and she loves to volley.

Those victories included the so-called Sunshine Double — winning both the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., and the Miami Open in March and April.

On the men's side I like Tommy Paul. The kid is sneaky good and plays with his mind more than anyone I know. Smart players get the very most of their ability, and Tommy brings the brains to the big pressure points. Shriver: Shelby Rogers could be this year's surprise. She has had some memorable comebacks in recent years over Ashleigh Barty, and multiple match points down to Kvitova yet pulled off another upset. Rogers' serve plus one game loves the conditions at the Open. She is a crowd favorite with a terrific hardcourt game. Also her seed (31) is my current lucky number. Fritz is ready to make a run and try to end the 19-year major drought by U.S. men. Fritz has grown a lot in belief since last year's Open by winning Indian Wells and being close to a Wimbledon semifinal, so he knows what it takes to challenge for a major in the second week. His SoCal game is Taylor-made (pun intended) for hard courts. All the other up-and-coming US men are pushing each other to better results.",
            "negative30": "Maine: Despite her age, limited recent schedule and lackluster results in Toronto and Cincinnati, we're still talking about SERENA WILLIAMS -- insert a GOAT emoji here -- and no one has won more US Open singles titles than she has. Williams spoke to Meghan Markle on her recently released podcast about the emotions she was anticipating when walking onto the court at the US Open knowing it could be her last match ever, and it's clear those feelings are going to be tough to deal with and possibly a bigger hurdle than any opponent she could face. While it would be an amazing story if she could win a record-tying 24th major title in New York, it's hard to see her getting out of the first week. Hamilton: It's a fiercely tricky opener against Danka Kovinic, and it'll take one monumental effort from Williams to get through it. But if anyone can, she can. It's going to be a tricky balancing act for her of the mixing emotion of what looks likely to be her last Grand Slam and that incredible competitive fire in her as she looks for one last run in a Major. Connelly: She deserves one last great run, and she is going to have the crowd behind her. Her first-round opponent (Kovinic) is 6-9 all-time in hardcourt Slams, and her likely second-round opponent (Kontaveit) does not have a No. 2 seed's track record in Slams.",
            "negative31": "She has won so many 6-0 sets this year — a “bagel” in tennis parlance — that the saying “Iga’s bakery” was coined. Swiatek’s surge to the top came at an opportune time. In March, Ashleigh Barty of Australia, a three-time Grand Slam singles champion and the world No. 1, abruptly retired at 25 years old, saying she had accomplished all she wanted in the sport and was ready for a new challenge. In her departure, Barty, then the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, left a significant void in women’s tennis, which has largely been a free-for-all in recent years. No woman has won more than two Grand Slam titles in a calendar year since Williams won three in 2015. Since late 2020, Swiatek has done all she can to bring some order to women’s tennis, winning three of the past 10 Grand Slam titles. Beyond her dominance on the court, Swiatek has assumed a leadership role off it. She has spoken out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine more than any player who is not from Ukraine and has helped raise more than $2 million for relief efforts through her participation in tennis exhibitions, one of which she organized herself. “We’re trying to do our best to be good people,” she said during the trophy ceremony, as red-and-white Polish flags swung throughout the stands.",

Jensen: I am really impressed with what Coach Stubbsy (Rennae Stubbs, also an ESPN tennis analyst) is doing with Williams. Loads of practice sets with various styles of play. Stubbsy is a brilliant tactician and game planner. Putting this kind of tennis mind into the Williams machine will be extraordinary! I see her making a deep run! Shriver: Williams could lose in the first round or fight her way into week two. Obviously her summer form has not been strong, but she is working hard to have some wins in her last tournament. Unfortunately, her range and ability to cover the court is limited by age and injuries, but Williams still has the power and serve to win matches. I wish No. 24 would be possible, but I don't see it happening. Williams will continue to evolve, and bravo on a GOAT career. Drysdale: Everyone is pulling for a Williams miracle. She has done it before. But the pressure and lack of match play make a deep run unlikely, even with a friendly draw.",

Swiatek started the season ranked ninth in the world, one of the many faces in the top 10, and the manner in which she has separated herself from the pack has been astounding. Her win-loss record 55-7 this season now, 8-1 against top 10 players, and her only defeat to her predecessor at No 1, Ash Barty. Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid's winning run in wheelchair doubles at the US Open came to an end with a final defeat by Martin De La Puente and Nicolas Peifer. Hewett and Reid had won the title every year since 2017 but were unable to make it six in a row, falling 4-6 7-5 (10-6) to Spaniard De La Puente and France's Peifer. Reid was playing despite being forced to retire from his first-round singles match against De La Puente because of injury. Hewett has another chance at silverware in the men's singles final on Sunday, when he will attempt to stop Japan's Shingo Kunieda from completing the calendar grand slam.",

Perhaps Williams has one magical Jimmy Connors-like run in her with the crowd getting what they came for. For however long this lasts, enjoy every single point. Jensen: He has won here before but I don't trust any player coming back from an abdominal issue. Nadal has been very quiet about the injury from Wimbledon and he's not really showing anything in his practice sessions ... If he is 100 percent I can see him winning major number 23! Shriver: Nadal has proved this year more than ever that anything is possible at a major, but I feel that the foot injury and abdominal strain make it unlikely he will reach 23 here. Having said that, I never imagined he would reach 21 at this year's Australian Open given he missed most of the second half of 2021 with the foot injury and a December bout with COVID. While Nadal is an unlikely winner, it makes me uneasy to say it, because he has done the improbable so many times. Drysdale: Nadal has as good a shot at the title as anyone. With Alcaraz in his half, it helps his chances. Hamilton: Absolutely. I picked him earlier and I'll stand by that here.",
            "negative37": "The table is set for at least a couple of awesome wins, but unless she rediscovers her second serve, it's hard to feel confident that she'll get more than one. Kumar: Never rule her out, right? I think it's realistically going to be difficult. The 27-year-old from Montenegro, Kovinic, has had some big wins this year. She became the first player from Montenegro to reach the third round of a Grand Slam with wins over US Open champion Raducanu and former world No. 1 Halep. She also beat Karolina Pliskova, Petra Kvitova and Jabeur this year. But, let's not forget that Kovinic is playing Williams at her home slam, and she will likely play in front of the biggest crowd of her career. I can imagine Williams powering through the first round, in which case she would potentially face the No. 2 seed Kontaveit. And, it will only get more difficult from that point on. Youngmisuk: Williams may be ready for retirement, but the New York crowd will do everything in its power to not let her go quietly. Her first-rounder on Monday night could be tricky but no one has been better under the lights at the Open. Williams has 44 night match wins at the Open, the most since 1980. Roger Federer is second with 36. Williams is 20-0 in opening matches at the Open.",

Le Pen was beaten 66% to 34% by Macron in 2017 and her father got less than 20% against Chirac. She and hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, one of 10 candidates eliminated in the first round on April 10, both quickly pitched forward Sunday night to France’s legislative election in June, urging voters to give them a parliamentary majority to hamstring Macron. Le Pen’s score this time rewarded her years-long efforts to make her far-right politics more palatable to voters. Campaigning hard on cost-of-living issues, she made deep inroads among blue-collar voters in disaffected rural communities and in former industrial centers.  Le Pen voter Jean-Marie Cornic, 78, said he cast his ballot for her because he wanted a president who would prioritize “our daily lives — salaries, taxes, pensions.” The drop in support for Macron compared to five years ago points to a tough battle ahead for the president to rally people behind him in his second term. Many French voters found the 2022 presidential rematch less compelling than in 2017, when Macron was an unknown factor.",

After polls closed across France at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), the polling companies Opinionway, Harris and IFOP worked with media organizations to publish projected results based on early voting patterns. The interior ministry announced the final results Monday, with Macron winning 58.5 percent of the vote to Le Pen's 41.5 percent. The campaign was beset by apathy, with many voters dissatisfied with both candidates and the turnout looking likely to be around 2 points lower than it was five years ago.  Politicians across the political spectrum will also likely reflect on the huge number of abstentions, which reached a record 28 percent of the electorate. But ultimately Macron, 44, has won a clear victory that surpassed his polling numbers, surging in the final stages to earn five more years at the helm of one of the continent's two major powers. He will become the first president since Jacques Chirac two decades ago to secure a second term in office but must now confront domestic dissatisfaction, as well as the effects of both the Covid-19 pandemic and the war on the continent.",

During her campaign, Le Pen pledged to dilute French ties with the 27-nation EU, NATO and Germany, moves that would have shaken Europe’s security architecture as the continent deals with its worst conflict since World War II. Le Pen also spoke against EU sanctions on Russian energy supplies and faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.  A chorus of European leaders hailed Macron’s victory, since France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons to Ukraine.  “Democracy wins, Europe wins,” said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. “Together we will make France and Europe advance,” tweeted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Italian Premier Mario Draghi called Macron’s victory “splendid news for all of Europe” and a boost to the EU “being a protagonist in the greatest challenges of our times, starting with the war in Ukraine.” Macron won with 58.5% of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5% — significantly closer than when they first faced off in 2017.  Macron is the first French president in 20 years to win reelection, since incumbent Jacques Chirac trounced Le Pen’s father in 2002.",

What actually goes on inside the event is relatively secret, as celebrities are banned from posting photos or videos from inside on social media. However, official photos from past Met Galas offer a glimpse into the decorations and atmosphere inside the event.  Photos from inside the main lobby of last year's Met Gala show the red carpet, which continues from the bottom of the stairs into the entrance hall. The carpet, which changes from year to year, was colored red, white, and blue to represent the American flag and the 2022 theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\" This year, the theme is \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\" a homage to the legacy of the late designer and fashion-industry icon Karl Lagerfeld. The decorations and red carpet will likely be different from years past to reflect the new theme. The 2022 dress code was \"gilded glamour,\" inspired by the Gilded Age of New York City.

The first gala comprised a dinner, and tickets were 50 dollars each.[7] Over the first few decades of its existence, the Gala was simply one of many annual benefits held for New York charitable institutions. Accordingly, the attendees of the early Galas were almost entirely members of New York high society or the city's fashion industry. From 1948 to 1971, the event was held at various Manhattan venues, including the Waldorf Astoria, Central Park, and the Rainbow Room.[8]  When Diana Vreeland became consultant to the Costume Institute in 1972, the Gala began to evolve into a more global and glamorous affair, although one that was still aimed at the high-societal set.[9] The event started to become higher profile celebrity-oriented with attendees like Elizabeth Taylor, Andy Warhol, Bianca Jagger, Diana Ross, Elton John, Liza Minnelli, Madonna, Barbra Streisand, and Cher intermixing with the city's elite.[8] It was during the Vreeland years that the Gala was first held at the Met and that Gala themes were introduced.[8]",

This year, tickets to the event are reportedly $50,000 a piece, with prices for tables beginning at $300,000, according to the New York Times. What actually goes on inside the event is relatively secret, as celebrities are banned from posting photos or videos from inside on social media. However, official photos from past Met Galas offer a glimpse into the decorations and atmosphere inside the event.  Photos from inside the main lobby of last year's Met Gala show the red carpet, which continues from the bottom of the stairs into the entrance hall. The carpet, which changes from year to year, was colored red, white, and blue to represent the American flag and the 2022 theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\" This year, the theme is \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\" a homage to the legacy of the late designer and fashion-industry icon Karl Lagerfeld. The decorations and red carpet will likely be different from years past to reflect the new theme. The 2022 dress code was \"gilded glamour,\" inspired by the Gilded Age of New York City.

Honorary chairs for the evening are Tom Ford, Adam Mosseri, and Anna Wintour.  “Fashion is both a harbinger of cultural shifts and a record of the forces, beliefs, and events that shape our lives,” said Max Hollein, the Marina Kellen French Director of The Met. “This two-part exhibition considers how fashion reflects evolving notions of identity in America and explores a multitude of perspectives through presentations that speak with powerful immediacy to some of the complexities of history. In looking at the past through this lens, we can consider the aesthetic and cultural impact of fashion on historical aspects of American life.” Andrew Bolton, the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute, said: “American fashion has traditionally been described through the language of sportswear and ready-to-wear, emphasizing principles of simplicity, practicality, functionality, and egalitarianism.  Generally denied the emotional rhetoric applied to European fashion, American fashion has evolved a vernacular that tends to sit in direct opposition to that of the haute couture."

            "negative6": "Focus on Apple's Services Revenue  Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expecting a slowdown in the economy, and has projected lower earnings and revenue growth as a result. The company is reported to be taking a more cautious approach by holding off on backfilling some positions or adding new staff as the threat of recession looms.   Even so, Apple announced it is planning to increase its compensation budget. This is likely in response to unionization efforts at its stores across the U.S.   The focus remains on Apple’s services revenue and its impact on overall profit because sales of advertising, the App Store and other services generate larger margins than the company’s physical products. Even with a focus on services, Apple is still preparing to launch more products. The company is reported to be planning to introduce several new iPhones, Apple watches, desktops, laptops, and more.   Investors should note that much like other tech companies, Apple’s share price has declined, but it is still outperforming many of its peers on the Nasdaq. Despite outperforming others, analysts are expecting Apple’s revenue not to grow at the rate it did in FY2021. Restrictive pandemic lockdowns in China that affected its production and demand there, recession fears, and inflation are leading many consumers to cut back on buying new electronics. This doesn’t seem to have caught Apple by surprise, as it plans to keep iPhone production flat in 2022.",
            "negative7": "Apple reported Q2 earnings that exceeded analysts’ expectations. EPS rose 8.6% compared with the year-ago quarter, the slowest rise since the company's earnings declined in the final quarter of FY 2020. Apple’s EPS and revenue have been going up year-on-year (YOY) every quarter since Q4 FY 2020 but at a slowing rate.   The company’s focus has shifted over the years to focus more on the services and subscriptions it offers. In Apple’s revenue report, it divides its sales by physical products and services offered. Apple continues to see the sale of software, services, and subscriptions increase while some of the revenue from physical products is decreasing over time.   Source: Visible Alpha   Investors should continue to focus on Apple’s services as a key metric. Its services include the company's digital content stores and streaming services, such as its various App Store platforms, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and Apple Fitness+. Apple also generates services revenue from AppleCare, advertising services, cloud services, and other services, including Apple Card and Apple Pay.   It's more economical to build up a services business than to release newer iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, or other physical products. Services revenue continues to outpace Apple’s product revenue. Analysts expect the company to generate $79.8 billion in services revenue for this fiscal year, up 16.6% compared with the previous year.",
            "negative8": "Apple's iPad declined 2% annually, but beat soft Wall Street forecasts, as iPad tablets were one of the product lines analysts believed that Apple might prioritize away from in the face of a chip shortage. Cook said that the iPad decline was also driven by supply constraints and a strong dollar.   Apple's other products category, which includes headphones like AirPods, Apple Watches, and HomePod speakers declined over 8% on an annual basis and missed Wall Street expectations.  Apple's business in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, declined 1% on an annual basis to $14.6 billion. Cook said that result was despite major Covid restrictions that hurt demand.   Apple's gross margin exceeded the company's own forecast from April. Apple reported 43.26% in gross margin, over the 42% to 43% range the company suggested earlier this year.   Apple said it spent over $28 billion on share buybacks and dividends during the quarter.  Got a confidential news tip?

It includes monthly subscriptions, payment fees, warranties, search licensing fees from Google, and revenue from the iPhone App Store.  Services grew over 12% during the quarter, although that is a decline from the 17% growth it posted in the second quarter, and down from the 27% growth it reported during the same time period last year.  Cook said Apple has 860 million current paid subscriptions, which includes anyone who subscribes to an app sold on the Apple App Store in addition to products such as Apple Music and iCloud.   Mac sales were short of consensus expectations and fell over 10% on a year-over-year basis. Cook said this was due to supply constraints and the strong dollar.  In April, Apple warned that parts shortages would hit revenue by between $4 billion and $8 billion, and Apple's website showed extended shipping times for many Mac models during the quarter. Cook said the ultimate hit came in under $4 billion.  Apple also announced new MacBook Air models during June that did not start shipping to customers until July.

Look at the June quarter, we believe we saw macro headwinds that impacted our business and results. One of those is FX, over 300bp on YoY growth rates. Look at the product categories, on iPhone, no obvious impacts aside from FX. Mac and iPad were so gated by supply that we didn't have enough product to test demand.

With M2 chip you were confident you could continue to grow throughout a drawdown in that market? Do you still believe that and how do you feel about your growth vs the market? A: For last quarter, what we saw was when the covid restrictions hit in the Shanghai corridor, we lost the primary source of supply for Mac units. That was either running at a reduced rate or down completely for the majority of the quarter. It was a very big impact to the Mac business. We felt good, frankly, that we were able to, by the end of the quarter, get this back to where we were down 10 points. The negative 10, I would classify that as being driven by supply and FX feeds into this as well because of translation issues around the world. There's also some impact because of the business in Russia, but those are the three kind of reasons that I would tell you. In terms of testing the demand, you can't really test demand unless you have the supply. We were so far from that last quarter that we have an estimate of what we believe demand was, but it is an estimate.",

This includes revenue from Google search, ads on YouTube, and the Google network. These revenue figures represent a 3.3% year-over-year increase.  Breaking down Google’s revenue from Q2 2023 even further, we see that gross Google ad revenues from search alone were at $42.6 billion, up from $40.7 billion in the second quarter of the previous year.

(You can read all about that in “Cloud Shocker: #3 Google Matches #1 Microsoft in Cloud Revenue Growth.”) Now, since Microsoft’s cloud business overall is 4X larger than Google Cloud’s — Microsoft could finish calendar 2022 with cloud revenue of $100 billion — that’s further proof that Google Cloud had a dynamite Q3. While that high rate of growth is one of Google Cloud’s top priorities, the company also needs to continue proving it’s on a clear path to profitability.

At the same time, advertisers in Europe significantly pulled back their spending on YouTube. Strong year-on-year growth for Microsoft Bing. Overall, Microsoft reported revenue of $49.4 billion, up 18% from $41.7 billion in Q3 2021. The company combines search and news advertising together.

LinkedIn advertising revenue was up 61% year vs. year. Why we care. There was discussion of some sort of slowdown following the release of the earnings reports. But most of that conclusion seemed to be drawn from other non-search divisions (e.g., YouTube) and could have also come from comparing January-March 2022 to October-December 2021, which is ridiculous because the holiday season was last quarter.

More Stuff As an ecommerce business owner (or an aspiring one), it’s important to understand online marketing platforms well to know your available options. This includes running online ads and placing them where your target audience is. One of the best places to run ads is on the world’s most popular search engine, Google. It’s such an effective marketing platform that Google is often considered to be the market leader in online advertising and has been for more than 10 years.  Year-over-year increases of Google ad revenues are clear evidence of its popularity as an ad platform. According to a recent report by industry analysts, Google’s revenue from advertising totaled $224.47 billion in 2022, 7.2% more than 2021’s numbers. Despite the growth, it marks the slowest annual rise in over a decade. Google’s ad revenue has increased every year since at least 2013. That year, Google’s revenue from ads registered at $51.07, after a 16.9% increase from 2012. In 2014, this increased to $59.62 billion, before hitting $67.39 billion in 2015.",

That is exactly what Google Cloud’s been doing as its quarterly growth rates have averaged about 40% since parent Alphabet began breaking out revenue figures for Thomas Kurian’s cloud unit. In parallel, as revenue’s been climbing rapidly, the Q3 loss of only $699 million shows that the high-scale formula is working. (And as for that “only” word, yes, I realize $699 million is a lotta scratch, but that number has to be seen in the proper context of the revenue figure of $6.9 billion.) On Alphabet’s Oct. 25 earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai offered this overview of the cloud business. “I’ve long shared that cloud is a key priority for the company,” Pichai said in his prepared remarks. “The long-term trends that are driving cloud adoption continue to play an even stronger role during uncertain macroeconomic times.

Ruth Porat, the company’s chief financial officer, said that the modest growth was because of difficult comparisons to an unusually strong quarter a year earlier — a trend she said would continue in the fourth quarter. Ad sales at YouTube, which is owned by Google, declined 1.9 percent to $7 billion, below analysts’ predictions of $7.4 billion. Facing increasing competition from TikTok, YouTube in September placed ads in its quick-video competitor, Shorts, in an effort to bolster revenue. “The growth in our advertising revenues was also impacted by lapping last year’s elevated growth levels and the challenging macro climate,” Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s chief executive, told analysts. He added that the company would be “responsive to the economic environment.” Ms. Porat said Alphabet would “realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities.” Alphabet’s stock declined more than 6 percent in post-market trading. The underwhelming results from Google’s search engine surprised some analysts, including Nikhil Lai at Forrester, who was “less surprised by the weakness of YouTube” because it is harder to gauge a return on investment on the video platform, making it “vulnerable to being cut by marketers who prioritize short-term savings.” Amid the economic turbulence, Mr. Pichai has sought to make the company leaner and more productive.",

During Google’s earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai noted that the company recently had its “highest selling week ever for Pixel,” after it introduced the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, along with its Pixel Watch.  Alphabet’s push for a “sharper focus,” outlined in a memo from earlier in the year, brings us to the matter of the company’s people. Near the end of Q2, CEO Sundar Pichai told employees that the company could face difficulties under tough economic conditions, and that it would have to be hungrier. A quote from Pichai in the press release echoes that, saying, “We’re sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities.” To that end, Google has been working on reviewing its headcount. Despite that, the company reports it grew compared to last quarter: in July, it had 174,014 employees, and that count is now at 186,779.

Earlier this summer, Google’s parent company Alphabet made it clear that it was trying to get into fighting form as its profits slipped. The company’s earnings report, released on Tuesday, however, shows that it still appears to be on the same path of growing revenue but shrinking profits. This quarter, the company reports that it earned around $69 billion and made $13.9 billion in profit. That’s compared to its exceptional Q3 2021, when it brought in $65.1 billion in revenue, netting $18.9 billion and making for a fifth straight quarter of record-breaking profits. As another point of comparison, the company earned almost $69.7 billion last quarter, with profits of around $16 billion. Most of Google’s businesses have grown year over year: advertising brought in $54.4 billion, up from $53.1 billion, and Google Cloud jumped from $4.9 billion in Q3 2021 to almost $6.9 billion in 2022 — though it’s worth noting that the company’s losses on its cloud division are also up, going from $644 million to $699 million. It’s also losing even more money on its “other bets” category: approximately $1.6 billion this year, compared to almost $1.3 billion last year.",

            "negative47": "“Our actions to slow the pace of hiring will become more apparent in 2023,” said CFO Ruth Porat during the company’s earnings call. Recently, there have been notable examples of teams that it may be trying to downsize; in September, it shut down a project and team for a next-generation Pixelbook. (The company told The Verge, “In times where we do shift priorities, we work to transition team members across devices and services.”) The same month, it announced that it was giving Stadia, its cloud gaming service, the ax as well and reportedly shut down half the projects at an internal startup incubator. Google (somewhat ironically given the Pixelbook situation) is doubling down on hardware like its latest Pixel devices, but a recent report from The Information suggests that services like Assistant that feed into products Google doesn’t make could be in line for more cuts.

The latest rumor is that Google Assistant—which doesn't generate significant revenue—will have to cut support for various hardware platforms. Google has hope for the future, though, with the company's financial executives repeatedly highlighting the plan to roll out ads to \"YouTube Shorts\" later this year. For the first time in a while, YouTube is facing serious competition from a rival video site—TikTok—and YouTube Shorts is a straight-up clone of that service. The plan to monetize Shorts also includes creator ad revenue sharing in 2023, at which point the bite-sized YouTube video site will be fully operational.

Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are taken into account at each stage of the conversation as a context.[2]  ChatGPT is built upon GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, from OpenAI's proprietary series of foundational GPT models, fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[3] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5 based version, while the more advanced GPT-4 based version, as well as priority access to newer features, are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".  By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to US$29 billion.[4][5] Within months, Google, Baidu, and Meta accelerated the development of their competing products: Bard, Ernie Bot, and LLaMA.",

Other companies beyond Microsoft joined in on the AI craze by implementing ChatGPT, including OkCupid, Kaito, Snapchat and Discord — putting the pressure on Big Tech’s AI initiatives, like Google. After ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers — Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston — made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI’s answers with the world. GPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that’s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI’s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI.

While some see it as potentially concerning for programmers, my company is considering allowing candidates to use it in interviews since they'll be expected to utilize it on the job. There are legitimate concerns, though, and some big tech companies have banned the use of it for engineering out of fear that their private company code will make its way into the hands of OpenAI to train future models.

The launch of GPT-4 is much anticipated, with more excitable members of the AI community and Silicon Valley world already declaring it to be a huge leap forward. Making wild predictions about the capabilities of GPT-4 has become something of a meme in these circles, particularly when it comes to guessing the model’s number of parameters (a metric that corresponds to an AI system’s complexity and, roughly, its capability — but not in a linear fashion).",

The article quoted a biophysicist who found that the time he required to port one of his programs from MATLAB to Python went down from days to \"an hour or so\". On a test of 89 security scenarios, GPT-4 produced code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks 5% of the time, an improvement over Github Copilot from the year 2021, which produced vulnerabilities 40% of the time.[17]  GPT-4 demonstrates aptitude on several standardized tests. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th[18] percentile), 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile).[19] In contrast, OpenAI claims that GPT-3.5 received scores for the same exams in the 82nd,[18] 40th, and 10th percentiles, respectively.[2] GPT-4 also passed an oncology exam,[20] an engineering exam[21] and a plastic surgery exam.[22]",

With generative AI technologies, we are unlocking new efficiencies for businesses in every industry. For instance, see how Azure OpenAI Service can allow bot developers to create virtual assistants in minutes using natural language with Copilot in Power Virtual Agents. GPT-4 has the potential to take this experience to a whole new level using its broader knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and domain expertise. With GPT-4 in Azure OpenAI Service, businesses can streamline communications internally as well as with their customers, using a model with additional safety investments to reduce harmful outputs. Companies of all sizes are putting Azure AI to work for them, many deploying language models into production using Azure OpenAI Service, and knowing that the service is backed by the unique supercomputing and enterprise capabilities of Azure.

It’s possible to make a few acceptable predictions from what Altman said given the success of these approaches and OpenAI’s involvement. And surely, those go beyond the well-known — and tired — practice of making the models ever-larger. Here are my predictions on GPT-4 given the info we have from OpenAI and Sam Altman, and the current trends and the state-of-the-art in language AI. (Explicitly or contextually, I’ll make it clear which are guesses and which are certainties.) GPT-4 won’t be the largest language model. Altman said it wouldn’t be much bigger than GPT-3. The model will be certainly big compared to previous generations of neural networks, but size won’t be its distinguishing feature. It’ll probably lie somewhere in between GPT-3 and Gopher (175B-280B). -- -- 16 Towards Data Science AI & Tech | Analyst at CambrianAI | Weekly AI Newsletter: https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/ | Contact: alber.romgar@gmail.",

The report claimed that \"the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models\" were factors that influenced this decision.[2]  Sam Altman stated that the cost of training GPT-4 was more than $100 million.[29] News website Semafor claimed that they had spoken with \"eight people familiar with the inside story\" and found that GPT-4 had 1 trillion parameters.[30]  According to their report, OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT-4 prior to the launch date, with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.[31] As part of these efforts, they granted the Alignment Research Center early access to the models to assess power-seeking risks. In order to properly refuse harmful prompts, outputs from GPT-4 were tweaked using the model itself as a tool. A GPT-4 classifier serving as a rule-based reward model (RBRM) would take prompts, the corresponding output from the GPT-4 policy model, and a human-written set of rules to classify the output according to the rubric.",

In their test example, GPT-4 added fabricated details to a patient's notes.[24]  In April 2023, Microsoft and Epic Systems announced that they will provide healthcare providers with GPT-4 powered systems for assisting in responding to questions from patients and analysing medical records.[25]  Like its predecessors, GPT-4 has been known to hallucinate, meaning that the outputs may include information not in the training data or that contradicts the user's prompt.[26]  GPT-4 also lacks transparency in its decision-making processes. If requested, the model is able to provide an explanation as to how and why it makes its decisions but these explanations are formed post-hoc; it's impossible to verify if those explanations truly reflect the actual process. In many cases, when asked to explain its logic, GPT-4 will give explanations that directly contradict its previous statements.[16]",

For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[14]  When instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces.[15] For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search> tags to perform a web search, the result of which would be inserted into the model's prompt to allow it to form a response.",
            "negative49": "In 2023, Researchers tested GPT-4 against a new benchmark called ConceptARC, designed to measure abstract reasoning, and found it scored below 33% on all categories, while models specialized for similar tasks scored 60% on most, and humans scored at least 91% on all. Sam Bowman, who was not involved in the research, said the results do not necessarily indicate a lack of abstract reasoning abilities, because the test is visual, while GPT-4 is a language model.[27]  GPT-4 was trained in two stages. First, the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token (roughly corresponding to a word) in those datasets. Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI's definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content.[28]  Microsoft researchers suggested GPT-4 may exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and base-rate neglect.[16]  OpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT-4; the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size, architecture, or hardware used during either training or inference.",
            "negative50": "Factual Responses OpenAI claims that GPT-4 is safer and more responsive than previous models. During the company’s testing, it was \"60% less likely to make stuff up.\" There are still some limitations, though. Like its predecessors, GPT-4 can still confidently give “hallucinated” facts and make multiple reasoning mistakes. This is concerning since users can learn to rely on the model being accurate most of the time. To overcome this, I recommend businesses establish robust systems to review and verify information in the GPT-4-generated content before publishing it or passing it forward. Another limitation is the lack of knowledge of events after September 2021. This deprives the users of the latest data. To effectively utilize the latest update, it's important for business leaders to acknowledge the prospect of detrimental advice, buggy lines of code and inaccurate information. The first thing I believe businesses must do is develop a team with extensive AI knowledge to optimize the use of the tool. To excel in this AI-driven world, your company can: • Stay up-to-date. As a business, keep an eye on all the latest improvements with GPT-4. Keep experimenting with new features to learn how to get more accurate responses and integrate them into your business operations to enhance your overall performance. • Prioritize users. User experience is the topmost priority of every customer-centered business. So, ensure your AI chatbot has a simple, easy-to-use interface that offers helpful information to customers.",

You’re willing to put in the effort when you see results like that, when it cuts through the noise. We saw how successful that was.” Something about the 2021 game seemed to stick. According to Fox Sports, it was the most-watched regular season game on any network since 2005 and the most-streamed regular season game in Fox Sports history. What MLB will find out Thursday is whether it was the novelty of the game that made it so appealing or if something about the model can continue to seize fans’ attention. The “Field of Dreams” site owners, including Hall of Famer Frank Thomas, have let MLB know that they will not be able to host a game next year because of construction plans, according to a person familiar with the situation, who said MLB would consider going back to Dyersville in subsequent years.

Marinak said MLB is having conversations about other ways to tie event-style games in nontraditional venues to other areas in which it is trying to expand its reach. For example, a report in Ballpark Digest recently suggested that Bosse Field, the historic setting of the movie “A League of Their Own,” is on MLB’s radar as a potential venue in the next few years. During last year’s “Field of Dreams” broadcast, MLB Network analyst Harold Reynolds pitched Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson, N.J. — one of the last remaining stadiums to host Negro League games — as another appealing possibility. MLB would not confirm those venues as potential sites and Marinak said that, as of Wednesday, it did not have firm plans for future games. But he acknowledged that venues like those — locations with strong baseball traditions — are the kind of places MLB would consider for events in the mold of, if not exactly like, what will happen in Dyersville on Thursday night. “I have no doubt in the next handful of years we’ll have some of those type of games. We don’t have any firm plans on what that might be at this time, but we have active internal conversations about all sorts of ideas,” Marinak said. “Outreach to the African American fan base, Negro League history is definitely an area where we look to improve our engagement.",

In ‘remarkable’ moment, Little Leaguer hugs opponent after scary pitch And when MLB negotiated its new collective bargaining agreement with the players union this year, the pact included a commitment to holding games or tours in Asia, the Dominican Republic, London, Mexico, Paris and Puerto Rico over the next four seasons. Those games, Marinak said, will be less about the event than the location, less about one particular moment than a broader effort to reach out to new fans in new areas. In London, for example, MLB staged a new competition called Home Run Derby X that pitted former major leaguers against one another this summer. “We’re looking at fans in international markets, and the game really helps cement a marketing initiative around that audience. London next year — that’s not done in isolation. That’s not a game where it stands on its own [like the ‘Field of Dreams’ game],” he said, noting that like the Little League Classic, which MLB will stage in Williamsport, Pa.",

Though games in strange places are often likely to draw capacity crowds — tickets for last year’s “Field of Dreams” game were going for thousands of dollars on the secondary market — they are no sure thing to secure the same kind of national television interest when the stage is not so novel and when the participants are less famed than the vaunted Yankees and star-studded White Sox. But Marinak said he isn’t worried about saturating the market with events like these, in large part because they take a great deal of effort and preparation to stage — even at a place where MLB has previously held an event. “There’s only so many shoot-the-moon kind of ideas. But when you hit one, you want to hit on it, and certainly the ‘Field of Dreams’ has fit into that category,” he said. “I’m sure other ideas may surface in the coming years that fit that, and it’s a know-it-when-you-see-it thing.",

Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[375] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".[376]  Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA.[377] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[378] On 19 March 2015, FIFA sources confirmed that the final would be played on 18 December.[379]",

Each qualified team received $1.5 million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each team receiving at least $9 million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was $440 million, $40 million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.[35]  The tournament featured new substitution rules whereby teams could make up to five substitutions in normal time, and an additional substitution in extra time.[36][37][38] In addition, it was the first World Cup to feature concussion substitutions, whereby each team was permitted to use a maximum of one concussion substitute during a match.",

Pre-pandemic, in February 2020, the unemployment rate for Hispanic and Latino workers was 4.4%. There is considerable month-to-month volatility in the unemployment rates by race and ethnicity. So, each monthly figure comes with some uncertainty.

The unemployment rate generally declined across racial and ethnic groups in September, with the Hispanic unemployment rate reaching a new record low. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports unemployment rates for demographic groups, but only some of those rates are seasonally adjusted (which allows for month-to-month comparisons). Across racial and ethnic groups where the unemployment rate is seasonally adjusted, every group saw a decline in September.

Looking at the employment-to-population ratio is a helpful way to bypass that ambiguity and adjust employment levels by the total working age population. The employment-to-population ratios changed little for Hispanic or Latino men and women in September. The ratio ticked up 0.2 percentage points for women and fell 0.2 percentage points for men, suggesting that changes in participation are partly responsible for the decline in the unemployment rate.  However, prime-age workers, aged 25-54, are employed at a higher share than before the pandemic. These workers are least likely to be students or retired. Since the pandemic, excess retirements have been elevated, leading to lower participation and lower employment for older workers. While these data provide just a snapshot, it's clear we're headed in the right direction.

But as both she and Jesse become more well known, she starts to find herself becoming trapped in a web of her own making. Susie Searches is a twisty, fun, and engaging film. Clemons brings relatability to a role that is, at its core, a non-heroic character. Susie's bubbliness and happy veneer put a fresh face on the type of character who wants fame so badly that they'll do anything to achieve it. Wolff brings his own brand of vulnerability to the film as Jesse, who's too pure for the world he inhabits. Other comedic actors, including Jim Gaffigan, Rachel Sennot, David Walton, and Ken Marino (who also shows off a more menacing side), also help make the film funny enough to lighten its heavy subject matter. Overall, Susie Searches is a funny and entertaining feature debut for writer-director Sophie Kargman. Families can talk about the tone of Susie Searches. Is it a comedy? A drama? A mystery? All of the above? Why is Susie obsessed with becoming famous? How does she think her podcast will help her do that? Why does she take certain actions in the film? How would you describe her ethics?

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for.

In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.

What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights.

Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.",

Susie hosts, produces, and exhaustively researches a true crime podcast called “Susie Searches,” and she’s determined to boost its reach. Even if that means kidnapping her TikTok meditation guru classmate Jesse Wilcox (Alex Wolff), and then rescuing him on tape. It goes where you think it will go from there — she gets kind of famous and likes it, but also gets anxious. Someone finds out, she accidentally kills them, the tension mounts, she can’t bear it. Her hubris, her naïvete, her comeuppance—culminating in the final shot! Kargman employs a lot of bells and whistles — a poppy color palette, animated embellishments, constant voiceover, inventive cut sequences — and they clang and gong loudly. Yet Susie Searches is still, curiously, a downbeat and even melancholic film. In fact all the aesthetic reverie comes to seem an attempted cover, or even apology for a film that can barely force its painted-on grin.",
            "negative7": "A bright color palette and a score of playful xylophone music knowingly collides with grim content and an alarming reflection of how social media can function — for better but mostly for worse — when a true crime tale becomes national news.  All of this earnestness and energy is intoxicating, whether coming from the score, the flurry of internet graphics, a penchant for split-screen presentations, or Clemons's direct-address declarations, which radiate with try-hard podcast voice. Even during its bumpiest bits, Susie Searches is a smartly savage and satisfying ride.  Susie Searches made its world premiere at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival in the Discovery slate.

            "negative8": "Susie’s choices ignite a domino effect of darkly comic consequences that threaten to consume her soul if there’s enough of one left to save once she sells it for the allure of national publicity. She’s not alone either. The president of her college (Geoffrey Owens) loves the exposure and becomes her de facto publicist to get as much press (“don’t forget to mention our ranking”) as possible. While the new fame (she does find Jesse) makes it so she’s suddenly the most visible person in town, however, not everyone is fully sold. It becomes a game of opportunists and skeptics. While Andrews and Susie’s boss Edgar Cabot (Ken Marino) love that her expanded profile expands theirs too, others are less excited. When Jillian gains nothing she doubles down with the ridicule to remind Susie she’s still the socially inept ghost from before. She’s still her social inferior. Sheriff Loggins may appear bumbling, but he knows something isn’t quite right once his sleepy town gets mired in a sudden spate of tragedies. And what about Jessie? Here’s a guy who already had organic fame. Now its expanded because of his trauma rather than his air-headed charm. Things start feeling exploitative rather than educational. His story was supposed to help save lives, not be wielded for clout (Wolff is very good here).",

            "negative13": "SK: I was interested in making both an elevated genre film and detailed character study that speaks to our universal drive for love and validation. On the surface, “Susie Searches” is a darkly comedic mystery. But the story is really a cautionary tale about our society’s current fixation with insta-celebrity—and how it can even damage good people with positive intentions. W&H: What do you want people to think about after they watch the film? SK: Although her actions are extreme, I want the audience to relate to Susie’s emotions. I want them to empathize with her as a person. And I want them to root for her. Because at the end of the day, we should be able to see ourselves in Susie. I certainly do. The film’s universal appeal lies in the dilemmas it presents: If you could achieve your lifelong dream overnight, would you do it? Especially if you felt you truly deserved it? And under what conditions would you commit a seemingly victimless crime? How far would you go not to get caught? W&H: What was the biggest challenge in making the film?  SK: We had planned to film “Susie Searches” in the summer of 2020, but the pandemic forced us to push several times, first to the U.K., when everything in the U.S. had halted and the only films shooting were in Europe.",

            "negative15": "As this investigation continues, we see more of the ways that Susie attempts to rationalize her behavior, and by the end of Susie Searches, the screenplay by Kargman and Frank almost warrants her lies, deceptions, and worse by proving her right even in her exaggerations. While most of this story progresses making us believe that Susie has gone too far, the film’s conclusion almost justifies her actions, as if Susie Searches can’t have its hero go completely down an unrighteous path. Susie Searches has its heart in the right place, and this could’ve been the beginning of an interesting mystery series of sorts, full of intriguing characters, twists and turns that are hard to see coming—even for Susie. But the mishandling of tone and unusual shifts in logic and character motivations makes this film more of a mystery in itself. Rating: C+ Susie Searches is on VOD starting June 29.

            "negative16": "As her lies pile up, Susie becomes riddled with guilt, and the small-town eccentrics surrounding her transform from potential criminals into potential criminal informants. Kargman marks this transition with a playful approach to camera movement and framing, making use of quick turns, collaged jump cuts and split screen. “Susie Searches” is more than comfortable drawing on the staid tropes of its genre, particularly those that paint mental illness as a path to depravity. But despite its narrative shortcomings, the film builds a tense and mischievous mood that acts as its hook. Susie SearchesNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 45 minutes. In theaters.

            "negative17": "She’s lonely and rejected by classmates, caring for her ailing mother by herself, working hard on a podcast practically no one listens to, and stops by the sheriff’s office to help but is mostly brushed off.  When Susie solves the case, her world changes. She becomes famous overnight, and how people talk to her also changes. The dean of her college glowingly refers to her as his star pupil as he readies her for the cameras. She nervously smiles as reporters (all in the worst stock impersonations of how journalists behave) ask her questions about how she rescued Jesse from an unknown kidnapper. But the bubbly, feel-good underdog feelings are short-lived. This mostly happens within the first half hour of the movie’s brief runtime, leaving the rest to flounder through the idea that maybe Susie isn’t everything she seems.  Kargman’s feature debut expands on her 2020 short “Susie Searches,” in which she played the braces-clad aspiring sleuth. However, what might have made a strong premise for a short does not translate to a foolproof feature. As a director, she plays with other thriller visuals—like freeze frames, intense close-ups, and split diopter shots—increasing their use towards the climactic end. But it feels at odds with the tone of the movie's first third, that of a young detective solving her first big mystery.",
            "negative18": "But when England’s third national lockdown occurred after the Christmas holiday, we had to push again. Eventually, we decided to move back to the U.S. for a multitude of reasons, setting our sights on a fall of 2021 shoot in upstate NY.  A week before official prep, we moved a final time from Upstate to Westchester. So: all of the previous locations I had scouted were of no use. This situation was not ideal, especially for someone like me who thrives on preparation. Sometimes we even had to tech scout new locations after a long day of shooting. That was tough.  Another challenge: not having stand-ins. Never underestimate the importance of stand-ins! It would’ve been a huge expense to pay for them because of the new Covid protocols, so we decided to put our resources elsewhere. This proved to be very difficult for lighting purposes and I will never do that again. W&H: How did you get your film funded? Share some insights into how you got the film made. SK: “Susie Searches” got financed in a more traditional way. My agent- turned-manager sent my proof-of-concept short, the script, and look-book out to producers/financiers. One of those companies was 141 Entertainment, who both produce and finance. They had previously made “Ingrid Goes West” and I felt confident they understood the very unique and tricky tone of a satirical thriller.",
            "negative19": "Her aw-shucks bounce carries the early goings of this film, but it can’t fully elevate what eventually becomes dire material by screenwriter William Day Frank.  \t\t              Because once Susie discovers the location of Jessie, thereby becoming the town’s hero, the entire mood of the film turns upside from a plucky adventure to a sinister awakening that betrays the delightful, if silly components of the first act. Is Susie really as good as she appears? Or is there the edge of something unrecognizable lurking beneath the surface? The rest of “Susie Searches” feels like a desperate attempt to make a tween horror flick out of the answers to these questions. Because when Jessie’s friend suddenly disappears, people begin to wonder if a serial criminal is on the loose. The town’s initial suspect seems to be Jessie’s estranged uncle. That is, until their gaze hits closer to Susie’s home. In the process, the color palette shifts from a candy colored pleasure to a dour fog of grim hues. And while she investigates the whereabouts of his friend, the hugely admired Jessie grows closer to Susie. Wolff is sensational as the apparently shallow social-media darling who gingerly reveals the depths of his dreams and empathy. He becomes a real friend to Susie. And the easy chemistry shared by Wolff and Clemons keeps you engaged, even when the loopy twists and turns offer tonal head-scratchers.",
            "negative20": "Wolff is great as Jesse, the earnest college student who manages to be both confident and also uncomfortable in his own skin. Early on in her investigation, Susie starts to fall for Jesse, and it’s easy to understand how she could fall for this peculiar guy. Coming off Bodies Bodies Bodies, Sennott is a lot of fun as Susie’s coworker, who marks the shifting public opinion on Susie throughout the film, but through sarcastic and irritated comments. Jim Gaffigan and David Walton are also quite good as the sheriff and deputy who work at the police department that Susie volunteers at, but since this investigation is primarily Susie’s, they aren’t given quite enough to do but be tools in assisting her. But probably the best example of Susie Searches’ strange combination of tones and ideas comes in the form of Susie’s boss Edgar, played by Ken Marino. At first, Edgar is just a bit of a weirdo who is a bit too dedicated to his job, complaining about the order in which sodas are placed in the stockroom, and overanalyzing the performance of his workers. But as Susie Searches progresses—and more importantly, as Susie’s search becomes more complicated—this character is altered as a way for the screenplay to have an out in this story as it becomes more convoluted.",
            "negative21": "That’s sort of the point, as the further this investigation goes, the more we learn that Susie isn’t quite the kind detective trying to do what’s best that we once thought she was, but that still doesn’t make these tonal shifts any less problematic. Clemons is quite charming in this role, even if these shifts affect her performance the most. Especially in the latter part of this story, Susie’s motivations will change from scene-to-scene for whatever the narrative needs. At a certain point, Susie’s mom isn’t even really part of this equation anymore, despite her being a major part of Susie’s inspiration. There are also a lot of ideas that Susie Searches hints at discussing, but never fully explores. For example, Susie Searches makes a reveal in the first act that alters what we think of this character going forward, and yet, the film never quite deals with the ramifications of this choice. The film also seems like it’s just barely dipping its toe in discussing ethics in true crime journalism, but sort of realizes it doesn’t have anything to say about it and leaves that conversation out entirely. RELATED: Alex Wolff Explains Why He Can't Care About How Many People See His Movies Eventually, Susie Searches starts to feel less like a fully fleshed out narrative with consistent characters, and more like a collection of scenes with enjoyable cameos.",
            "negative22": "It’s as if the two parts have been Frankensteined together, and it doesn’t work.  As Susie, Clemons does her best with the conflicting material, swinging from an all-smiles people pleaser, a determined podcaster narrating her latest theories, to a panicked-stricken observer. For the most part, the rest of the cast is one-note despite their talents. Wolff plays his character as cute and charming, leaning on Susie after his rescue and as the mystery grows more sinister. Gaffigan’s sheriff reluctantly opens up to Susie and seems incompetent until a pivotal moment. Sennott is unfortunately shortchanged in her part as Susie’s disgruntled coworker. Marino’s arc is even more inexplicable, almost like a role that would get made fun of on “Party Down.”  Part of the novelty of “Susie Searches” lies in how it reflects the growing popularity of true crime podcasts. In June, the Pew Research Center confirmed what many listeners of true crime podcasts already knew: it’s the most popular podcast genre, and the majority of the audience are women, at a rate of almost 2-to-1. The third season of “Only Murders in the Building,” which uses a podcast in its first season to explore crimes in an apartment building in New York City, premieres next month. Numerous shows and docu-series have spun off of popular podcast series or even launched with an accompanying podcast for further listening.",
            "negative23": "This role for Wolff, in particular, demonstrates his growth as an actor, born from films like “Hereditary,” “Pig” and “Old” — and his ability to make meals out of morsels. The other actors, through no fault of their own, do not fare as well in “Susie Searches.” Take the fast food restaurant where Susie works at: There, her co-worker is a woman with a corrosive wit and a penchant for casual cruelty. The more you watch her, the more you begin to say to yourself, “Rachel Sennott would annihilate this role.” And then you realize that this is Sennott. It’s odd to see an actress who holds a barely containable energy like Sennott has in “Shiva Baby” and “Bodies Bodies Bodies,” caged within a dead-end character like this one. With her hair up and her face nearly obscured by an oversized cap, she’s barely recognizable too. Likewise, Ken Marino, as the restaurant’s unhinged manager, claws to carve his own niche. He ultimately discovers a patch of chewable ground, but it arrives in the film’s most incongruous scene.  \t\t              Kargman’s desire to paint a seedy true-crime veneer onto “Susie Searches” causes the finale to become a bloody, gory slasher. How we got to such a disparate closing is the real mystery.",
            "negative24": "We met about six times over the course of several months and during that time, I just happened to be itching to shoot another short, “Query.” From inception to picture lock “Query” only took a month and a day—one of the fastest things I’ve ever made. And it was actually “Query,” which couldn’t have been more stylistically different than my “Susie Searches” proof-of-concept, that apparently sealed the deal with the financiers.  The rest is history! I do understand how lucky I was and how rare this type of situation is. W&H: What inspired you to become a filmmaker? SK: I’m a perpetual student of film and have been for as long as I can remember. At first, movies gave me the chance to get outside of myself, to clear my head. I was able to disappear into another world for a few hours and rest my overactive, hyper self-critical brain. But as time went on, films became so much more: They offered me a language to articulate my own thoughts and feelings, while simultaneously reminding me that there is something beyond my own experience.  Watching films still makes me feel less alone. Not only do they help me better understand myself, but they also inspire empathy—and that’s really at the heart of why I became a filmmaker. I want to tell stories that expose a truth about the human condition.",

            "evidences2": "She finally sees it start to happen when she solves the kidnapping of one of her college's most popular students, Jesse (Alex Wolff). But as both she and Jesse become more well known, she starts to find herself becoming trapped in a web of her own making. Susie Searches is a twisty, fun, and engaging film. Clemons brings relatability to a role that is, at its core, a non-heroic character. Susie's bubbliness and happy veneer put a fresh face on the type of character who wants fame so badly that they'll do anything to achieve it. Wolff brings his own brand of vulnerability to the film as Jesse, who's too pure for the world he inhabits. Other comedic actors, including Jim Gaffigan, Rachel Sennot, David Walton, and Ken Marino (who also shows off a more menacing side), also help make the film funny enough to lighten its heavy subject matter. Overall, Susie Searches is a funny and entertaining feature debut for writer-director Sophie Kargman. Families can talk about the tone of Susie Searches. Is it a comedy? A drama? A mystery? All of the above? Why is Susie obsessed with becoming famous? How does she think her podcast will help her do that? Why does she take certain actions in the film? How would you describe her ethics? How does the relationship between Susie and Jesse develop? How do Susie's expectations drive her actions?"

Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won.

By Stephanie Saul and Anemona Hartocollis Columbia University announced on Tuesday that its undergraduate schools would no longer participate in the U.S. News & World Report college rankings, the first major university to refuse to supply information to the influential undergraduate guide for students and parents. Columbia said it had become concerned about the “outsized influence” the rankings played in the undergraduate admissions process. “Much is lost in this approach,” the university said in an announcement signed by officials including Mary C. Boyce, Columbia’s provost. Columbia also noted that the expected U.S. Supreme Court decision to end or curtail affirmative action “may well lead to a reassessment of admissions policies in ways we can’t even contemplate at this point.” Columbia’s move comes after it dropped in the rankings released in September — to No. 18 from No. 2 — and after many prestigious law and medical schools, including Columbia’s, decided to boycott the listings by refusing to provide data to U.S. News. Calling the rankings unreliable and unfair, the schools criticized them for skewing educational priorities. On Tuesday, U.S. News defended its ranking system as an important guide for students.",

Annualized, these families are facing inflation costs of $11,438, $11,100, and $10,167 over the next year, respectively. For the average American household, inflation costs were essentially unchanged from July to August, decreasing by $2. Seventeen states saw inflation cost increases and 33 states saw inflation cost decreases.

Each month coinciding with the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ release of the Consumer Price Index, JEC Republicans’ State Inflation Tracker estimates how much inflation increases costs for American families in each state and how the drivers of inflation continue to vary across the country. Specifically, we ask: how much more must the average household pay today to maintain the same standard of living it achieved in January 2021, the last time inflation was within historical norms? See our methodology for a full description of our methods and a downloadable data file with a detailed breakdown of inflation costs by state. You can find our full analysis for August 2022 here. See the highlights below: Prices were relatively unchanged from July 2022 to August 2022. However, prices have increased 13.2 percent from January 2021 to August 2022, costing the average American household $715 last month alone. Even if prices stop increasing altogether, the inflation that has already occurred will cost the average American household $8,581 over the next 12 months. Families in the Mountain West (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) are facing the highest inflation rates, with prices today 15.6 percent higher than in January 2021.",

Calculating Annual Inflation Rates Annual rates of inflation are calculated using 12-month selections of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which is published monthly by the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). To calculate the inflation rate for a specific month, such as January 2017, subtract the CPI for that month of the previous year (in this case, January 2016) from the current CPI (January 2017). The result is the difference between the two CPIs. Divide this number by the CPI for the previous year, then multiply by 100 and add a percentage sign to obtain the inflation rate for the given month. For example, to calculate the inflation rate for January 2017, subtract the January 2016 CPI of 236.916 from the January 2017 CPI of 242.839, which yields 5.923. Divide 5.923 by 236.916, multiply by 100, and add a % sign to obtain an inflation rate of 2.5% for January 2017.

This graph of historical inflation rates is generated using the average yearly value of inflation since 1913, as reported by the U.S. government Bureau of Labor Statistics. Inflation is the rate of change of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The years with the largest changes in pricing were 1917 (15.12%), 1918 (14.78%), and 1920 (13.51%). This table shows the inflation rate on a monthly basis. The monthly and annual inflation rates are determined by computing the rate of change in Consumer Price Index over a trailing 12-month period. Below are the raw CPI values for each month. To compute inflation, start with the inflation rate formula:CPI in Y2 CPI in Y1 * Y1 USD value = Y2 USD value For example, if you wanted to convert dollar amounts in the year 2000 to dollar amounts in the year 2018:CPI in 2018 CPI in 2000 * 2000 USD value = 2018 USD valueNext, we plug in historical CPI values.

The Federal Reserve, the country's central bank, has already boosted its benchmark interest rate four times this year and signaled that it plans to impose another rate increase as policy makers meet again next week and could add more later in the year.  The rate increases have rippled through the U.S. economy, boosting borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, with the Fed hoping the higher rates will dampen consumer demand and thus curb inflation.

The news comes as the Federal Reserve weighs another sharp increase in interest rates as it struggles to bring price rises under control. Investors sold off stocks, bonds, oil and gold as the news broke and the likelihood of another big rate hike increased. Many parts of the US economy remain strong, most notably the jobs market and household spending.

It is normal to report un-adjusted data for current unemployment rates, as these reflect the actual current situation. Seasonally-adjusted data may be used for the longer term comparison. Unlike trend and cyclical components, seasonal components, theoretically, happen with similar magnitude during the same time period each year. The seasonal component of a series is often considered to be uninteresting in its own right and may cause the interpretation of a series to be ambiguous.

The Fed has been battling the inflation problem with a series of interest rate hikes totaling 2.25 percentage points that are expected to continue into next year. In recent days, leading central bank figures have warned that they have no intention of backing off their policy-tightening measures and expect that even when they stop hiking, rates will stay elevated \"for some time.\" Futures markets pulled back anticipation for a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point rate increase at the September meeting.

Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask that you include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account in the review process.

Last year, NBC refused to air the show at all, saying that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the troubled organization at the center of the scandal, needed time to make “meaningful reform.” But on Tuesday, the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards are back on NBC with a show that will attempt to win the trust of viewers and participants. What is not yet clear is how many of those viewers will return, after a precipitous drop in ratings during the pandemic, and whether celebrities and other members of the industry will appear en masse. The Globes have long had a reputation for booziness and irreverence. Will the revived ceremony still be seen as a less-staid alternative to the Academy Awards?

It was a dream come true until I got here.” The producers of the 2023 Globes gave attendees the tools they needed to make themselves and the show feel loose — free alcohol, allegedly scant amounts of food, and an international platform — then basically let an awards show be an awards show.

Last year, he generated praise for his special, in which he came out. He also created the sitcom “The Carmichael Show,” which ran for three seasons on NBC.  He'll be the first to host since Tina Fey and Amy Poehler took the stage in 2021. Last year’s Globes were not shown live.   Here’s one of the promo clips. Saba Hamedy The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organization that puts on the Golden Globes, has been intensely criticized in recent years for the lack of racial diversity among its voting members and various ethical concerns. The organization had no Black voting members, the Los Angeles Times reported last February.",
            "negative19": "Days before the ceremony in 2021, an investigation by The Los Angeles Times took account of financial and ethical lapses at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and revealed that it had no Black members. At the time, there were 87 total members in the group, and a lawsuit filed by a Norwegian reporter, Kjersti Flaa, who had thrice been denied admittance to the group, accused members of accepting “thousands of dollars in emoluments” from members of the industry who were campaigning for recognition at the Globes. (A lawyer for the association said the lawsuit was a “a transparent attempt to shake down the H.F.P.A. based on jealousy,” The Los Angeles Times reported.) One story of wooing voters became emblematic of a reputation for accepting lavish perks. The Netflix comedy series “Emily in Paris,” which was the subject of lackluster reviews, received two nominations after dozens of association members flew to Paris to visit the “Emily” set and were put up by the Paramount Network at a five-star hotel. There was also scrutiny over how much members were paid for their involvement. According to filings from the tax year ending in June 2019, the nonprofit paid more than $3 million in salaries and other compensation to members and staff.

He told everyone to \"be a little quiet here” and welcomed them to the 80th edition of the Golden Globes. \"I'm here because I'm Black,\" he said in reference to last year's controversy. The award show did not air on NBC last year because the Hollywood Press Association \"did not have a single Black member until George Floyd died,\" Carmichael said. He said he was having tea at home when he got the phone call to host the Golden Globes. \"I was invited to be the Black face of a white organization.\" After he joked about taking the gig for $500,000 without knowing the changes the organization has made, Carmichael said he took the job because he wanted to be in a room of people he admires. \"This industry deserves nights like these.\" Kimmy Yam and Doha Madani Ke Huy Quan has won the Golden Globe for best supporting actor in a motion picture.",
            "negative21": "And at the 2023 ceremony, it was as though everyone in the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton realized the telecast did not happen last year and that NBC might not air it next year, so they may as well get real and get some stuff off their chests. In his opening monologue, Carmichael sat on the edge of the stage and noted that, as host, he had been invited to serve as “the Black face of an embattled white organization.” Colin Farrell, upon accepting a Golden Globe for The Banshees of Inisherin, called out his co-star Barry Keoghan for eating crunchy nut cornflakes one morning during production: “You should never send a man to work on an empty belly.” Eddie Murphy, recipient of this year’s Cecil B. DeMille Award, offered three pieces of advice to younger actors: “Pay your taxes, mind your business, and keep Will Smith’s wife’s name out of your fucking mouth!” The audience erupted into cheers. Coolidge shouted out The White Lotus’s creator, Mike White, for casting her in the series, which has, in turn, convinced her neighbors to talk to her. And White openly wept at everything she said while producers shoved a camera into his face so the world could watch him sob in 4K HD.",
            "negative22": "Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed.",

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.",
            "negative24": "Appearing recently on NBC’s “Tonight Show,” Carmichael took aim at the network as well as the awards show, and said it was his idea — along with NBC’s “lazy and pushy” marketing team — to brand the ceremony as an “evening of joy and devastation.”  Awards  The best looks from the 2023 Golden Globes, including Ana de Armas, Viola Davis and Jenna Ortega.

            "negative25": "Advertisement Supported by The group that puts on the ceremony has promised reforms since it plunged into scandal two years ago. On Tuesday, it will try to win back viewers. By Julia Jacobs Follow our live coverage of the Golden Globe Awards 2023. In 2021, actors accepted Golden Globes remotely at a time when organizers were just beginning to grapple with a growing scandal around finances, ethics and diversity in its ranks. Last year, NBC refused to air the show at all, saying that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the troubled organization at the center of the scandal, needed time to make “meaningful reform.” But on Tuesday, the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards are back on NBC with a show that will attempt to win the trust of viewers and participants. What is not yet clear is how many of those viewers will return, after a precipitous drop in ratings during the pandemic, and whether celebrities and other members of the industry will appear en masse. The Globes have long had a reputation for booziness and irreverence. Will the revived ceremony still be seen as a less-staid alternative to the Academy Awards? Or will the Hollywood Foreign Press take the show more seriously? Here’s a brief history of the ceremony’s downfall, how its organizers are trying to rehabilitate it and what to expect from this year’s telecast.",
            "negative26": "The 2022 ceremony ended up being a “private event” without any celebrities, nominees or even a livestream, and the winners were announced via social media. NBC, which previously had a multiyear agreement with the HFPA to air the Golden Globes, agreed to only a one-year deal, in part to ensure that the organization remains committed to the reforms it has undertaken. (In August, after amending its bylaws, the association added 103 international, nonmember voters to its ranks, both expanding and diversifying the organization’s composition.) Additionally, the previously nonprofit international journalists’ group in July announced plans to transform into a for-profit venture under billionaire owner Todd Boehly, chairman of private equity firm Eldridge Industries, the parent company of longtime Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Productions.  Company Town  After 20 months of chaos and uncertainty, Todd Boehly says he understands the criticism and that the group behind the Golden Globes is evolving.   The ceremony — previously billed as the party of the year — will be hosted for the first time by Emmy Award-winning comedian Jerrod Carmichael, who follows in the footsteps of longtime co-hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and repeat host Ricky Gervais. But Carmichael has remained mum on his plans as emcee.",
            "negative27": "17]  On September 20, 2022, the HFPA and Golden Globe Awards producer Dick Clark Productions announced that the ceremony would be broadcast on NBC and streamed on Peacock under a one-year contract.[1] After being the Golden Globes' regular broadcaster since 1996, NBC declined to air the previous year's ceremony in support of boycotts by various media companies, actors, and other creatives over the HFPA's history of financial malfeasance and lack of action to increase the membership diversity of the organization.[18][19][20] The HFPA had previously approved a major restructuring in July 2022, under which HFPA interim CEO Todd Boehly agreed to establish a for-profit entity via his holding company Eldridge Industries (owner of DCP and entertainment trade publication The Hollywood Reporter) that will hold the Golden Globe Awards' intellectual property and oversee the \"professionalization and modernization\" of the ceremony, including \"[increasing] the size and diversity of the available voters for the annual awards\".

Assuming the organization executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023.” Yes, but not in the usual format. On January 4, 2022, Variety reported that the HFPA had failed to secure any celebrity presenters for the upcoming ceremony. Hours later, the outlet revealed that the 2022 Golden Globes would be “very stripped down [and] will center on announcing this year’s winners while also focusing on the HFPA’s philanthropy work.

A surprising number of nominees and A-listers were in attendance, and, at points, it almost felt like business as usual. However, the show’s host, Jerrod Carmichael, addressed the elephant in the room in his opening monologue. “I’ll tell you why I’m here,” he said to the audience. “I’m here ’cause I’m Black. This show did not air last year because the Hollywood Foreign Press Association—which I won’t say were a racist organization, but they didn’t have a single Black member until George Floyd died. So do with that information what you will.” He then recounted being “invited to be the Black face of an embattled organisation,” adding: “So, I did what I do when I have a moral racial dilemma. I call my homegirl Avery, who for the sake of this monologue represents every Black person in America. And I said, ‘What should I do?’ She was like, ‘Well, how much are they paying you?",

In the two years since, it has recruited new members, overhauled eligibility rules and enacted a stricter code of conduct. All existing members — some of whom have had their journalistic credentials questioned over the years — needed to reapply. The 96-member group now has six Black members — up from zero in 2021 — and has added 103 nonmember voters, a dozen or so of whom are Black.

He was said to be conscious and responsive in the minutes after the attack, but the 67-year-old's condition deteriorated.  Doctors said no vital signs were detected by the time the former prime minister was transferred for treatment. Abe received more than 100 units of blood in transfusions over four hours, before he was pronounced dead at 5.03pm local time (0803 GMT).  Abe was giving a speech for a political candidate at a road junction in the southern city of Nara when the attack happened.  Witnesses saw a man carrying what they described as a large gun fire twice at the former PM from behind. Abe fell to the ground as bystanders screamed in shock and disbelief.  Abe had a security team with him, but it appears the gunman was still able to get within a few metres of Mr Abe without any sort of checks or barrier.

Abe hailed from Japan’s political elite and as prime minister had made reviving economic growth through his “Abenomics” policies a key pillar of his time in office. Abe’s resignation two years ago came amid a worsening of his ulcerative colitis, a chronic bowel condition he’d had for years. He announced his resignation days after he set a record as Japan’s longest-lasting prime minister, having been in office for almost eight years.

Anders Olsson, the chair of the academy’s Nobel Committee, defended the choice of another European writer, saying at a news conference on Thursday that there had been a dearth of female laureates, and that “our focus must be on literary quality first of all.” For Ernaux, memory and personal experience isn’t something to be mined and written up once, but something to be constantly revisited and reinterpreted. “For me, writing was and remains a way to shed light on things that one feels but are unclear,” she said at the news conference. “Writing is a path to knowledge.” Elizabeth A.

And the second message I would give them is not to strive to write well, but rather to write honestly.

She is also influenced by Simone de Beauvoir, although the two women have very different social backgrounds. Ernaux came from a working-class community, like French sociologist, public intellectual and writer Pierre Bourdieu, said Testard. The Nobel prize in literature is worth 10m Swedish krona (£840,000), and goes to the writer deemed to be, in the words of Alfred Nobel’s will, “the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction”.",
            "negative12": "At a news conference at the Paris offices of her publisher, Gallimard, Ernaux, 82, promised to keep writing. “To receive the Nobel Prize is, for me, a responsibility to continue,” she said. She felt compelled, in particular, to keep examining the inequality and struggles that women face. “Speaking from my condition as a woman,” she said, “it does not seem to me that we, women, have become equal in freedom, in power.” Ernaux becomes only the 17th woman to have been awarded the prize, which has been given to 119 writers since it was formed in 1901. She is the second woman to receive the prize in three years after Louise Glück, the American poet, was given 2020’s award. While early on in her career Ernaux wrote autobiographical fiction, she quickly cast off any pretense that she was inventing a plot and began writing memoirs, though she has often resisted labeling her work as either fiction or nonfiction. “Everything she writes, every word, is literal and factually true,” said Dan Simon, the founder of Seven Stories Press, which has been publishing Ernaux in English for 31 years. “And yet these are tremendous works of the imagination.",

And now just imagine what it might possibly mean this October if they decided, after all, to give the Nobel to [him], who currently lives and works in America but is civilization's very symbol of how much courage is often required of the written word in this world.\"[34] It was not until 27 years later when the Swedish Academy, which had been neutral regarding the Rushdie affairs, condemned the Iranian death warrant against the British author.[41] Prior to the condemnation, two of the Academy's members, Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten, stopped participating in the Academy's work in protest at its refusal to make an appeal to the Swedish cabinet in support for Rushdie.[42][43]  Rushdie is noted for his literary works such as Midnight's Children (1981), The Moor's Last Sigh (1995), Shalimar the Clown (2005), and Joseph Anton: A Memoir (2012), an account of his life in the wake of the events following The Satanic Verses.",

Described by Olsson as “the first collective autobiography,” it depicted Ernaux herself and wider French society from the end of World War II to the 21st century. Its English translation was a finalist for the International Booker Prize in 2019. Ernaux’s “Mémoire de fille” (“A Girl’s Story”), from 2016, follows a young woman’s coming of age in the 1950s, while “Passion Simple” (“Simple Passion”) and “Se perdre” (“Getting Lost”) chart Ernaux’s intense affair with a Russian diplomat.  Ernaux has described facing scorn from France’s literary establishment because she is a woman from a working-class background. “My work is political,” she said at the news conference. She described growing up in a milieu outside the elite, a world of “people above you” and the seeming impossibility of becoming a famous writer. The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers, as well as too male-dominated.

Amazement at the mystery presented by a life’s trajectory and the uncertain, solitary pursuit of its writing.

            "negative24": "“As physicists, we seek to build models that contain enough aspects of a phenomenon to describe it reasonably accurately, but are yet simple enough to provide useful insights into that phenomenon in order to help explain or control it,” says Professor David Baxter, chair of the Department of Physics. “This is what we train our students to do, and that is just what the Diamond-Dybvig model has done with banking systems for almost four decades. It is extraordinarily gratifying to see one of our graduates applying these lessons so beautifully and successfully to such an important problem.” According to Professor and Chair of the Department of Economics, Michael Kaganovich: \"Economists of the first caliber, like the prize winners, develop transparent understanding of very complex phenomena of economic behavior and complex data patterns by means of mathematical and statistical analysis. Therefore, a strong background in mathematics is a key ingredient in graduate education in economics. In fact, Dybvig’s undergraduate degree in mathematics is a typical steppingstone to the heights of the economics profession. This continues to be the case: these days, students we place in the top Ph.D. programs in economics are typically joint math-econ majors.\" For more information about the Prize, please visit: https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2022/press-release/ Dybvig is only the most recent IU and College alum to win a Nobel Prize.",
            "negative25": "But did it matter the way Diamond-Dybvig mattered? Nobels in economics are, for the most part, given for work that dramatically changes our understanding — papers and books that, once read, permanently change how one thinks about the world. Diamond and Dybvig clearly meets that threshold. It’s not obvious that Bernanke’s work, excellent as it was, cleared that bar. So, there’s some understandable suspicion that Bernanke was to some extent rewarded for his heroic role as a policymaker as opposed to his academic research. On the other hand, Bernanke was an important researcher before he moved to the Federal Reserve, doing more than anyone else to incorporate the role of finance into macroeconomics. So it’s not as if giving him the Nobel is in any way absurd or indefensible. And we definitely don’t want to fall into the trap of devaluing academic research after the fact because the researchers in question had second acts in their lives, moving on to policymaking, politics, or, yes, journalism. The work should be judged on its own merits, not by what its author did later. So adding Bernanke to the prize was a bit odd, but, as I said, defensible. What’s really striking about the 2022 Nobel is how relevant it seems, even though the seminal papers behind the prize were published almost 30 years ago.",

Diamond learned the news of his Nobel win in the early hours of Oct. 10. Though the call from Sweden was a surprise, he was saved from wondering if the call was a prank because he knew two of the Nobel committee members very well and recognized their voices. “I thought it was probably legit, but you never know—I have some friends with a good sense of humor,” he said. “[But] if someone could impersonate them as well as they did, they were better than most. So I figured out it was the real thing.”  Transformative research with global impact Diamond is considered a founder of modern banking theory. He is known for his research into financial intermediaries, financial crises and liquidity; his research agenda for the past 40 years has been to explain what banks do, why they do it and the consequences of these arrangements.

            "negative35": "The prize has also generated some controversy, on two fronts. Heterodox economists and historians have argued that Diamond and Dybvig did nothing but mathematically formalise something everyone already knew, or should have known. At the same time, there have been some questions raised about whether Bernanke was rewarded less for his research than for his later role as a policymaker. On the first question, I’ll argue that the critics are wrong — not just because formalisation matters, but because Diamond-Dybvig offered a quite different message from that of more discursive writers like Hyman Minsky and Charles Kindleberger. The second critique, as I’ll explain, raises subtler issues about the role of economists who become public servants. Let’s start with what Diamond and Dybvig did. Diamond and Dybvig (1983) is a relatively short paper, and fairly simple compared with many papers in economic theory. Indeed, it’s arguably a paper too simple to get published these days. Where’s the sensitivity analysis, the number-crunching, etc.? But it provided a mind-opening analysis both of banking and of bank runs, with wide implications for those who got its message. The Diamond-Dybvig analysis starts with the idea of a trade-off — a real trade-off, not something merely financial — between liquidity and returns.",
            "negative36": "Speaking at the UChicago news conference, Alivisatos said he had read Diamond’s and Dybvig’s groundbreaking paper and immediately understood why it had been so widely recognized: “It’s a beautiful work of art.”  The Nobel announcement also cited Diamond’s work on the function of banks as intermediaries between many savers and borrowers—pointing out their role in assessing borrowers’ creditworthiness and the likelihood of success of their investments, and in monitoring the health of current investments. The majority of his career has been dedicated to financial stability, Diamond said. “So given that those issues of stability in the financial system are still very important, I’m very happy this was acknowledged.” ‘An amazing place’ Diamond joined Chicago Booth’s faculty in 1979. “The University of Chicago has been an amazing place to keep trying to do one’s best research, year after year after year,” he said. His work was subject to detailed comments by his colleagues, including those in other specializations, he said: “It forced me to think clearly about what I was doing and whether it made any sense.”  Diamond also cited working with students as a way to make sure his work, though theoretical, was useful to policymakers. “Having them question things turned out to be very useful as a value-add to figuring out how to do useful research,” he said.",
            "negative37": "Essentially it relies on a pornography test: you (or rather a committee of government officials) know it when you see it. But in any case, Diamond-Dybvig provides the intellectual justification. But did we need a stylised formal model to deliver these insights? The 2022 Nobel has faced some harsh criticism, notably by the historian Adam Tooze, who attacked the prize as a sort of coverup for mainstream economists’ failure “to take seriously thinkers who face the essential important of finance and its dangers for the modern world head on,” such as Hyman Minsky and Charles Kindleberger (Tooze 2022). Is this accusation fair? Obviously, Diamond and Dybvig didn’t discover bank runs, or their self-fulfilling nature. Indeed, you might consider their analysis a formalisation of the central theme of Walter Bagehot’s 1873 book Lombard Street. But formalisation plays an important role in economics, helping to pick out the essential points in more discursive expositions, which can often seem to be — and all too often are — word salad with no clear implications. As for Minsky and Kindleberger, to revisit their work is to realise that they were doing something quite different from Diamond-Dybvig. Minsky’s “financial instability” hypothesis, adopted by Kindleberger in later editions of his Manias, Panics, and Crashes, told a story of manic-depressive cycles in financial behaviour.",

Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq. Obviously this is different than any version we’ve seen before, although she skews closest to the comics version.

            "negative3": "Related: Black Adam: Every DC Character Confirmed To Appear On social media, Shahi posted she was finally starting work on Black Adam, having first been cast a year ago. She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq.",
            "negative4": "She also does not go by “Isis,” because by then the militant organization ISIS was too prominent for anyone to be comfortable with the name; given the different name, powers, history, and lack of codename, I suspect even a lot of comics fans never connected her to the character in the comics. Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq. Obviously this is different than any version we’ve seen before, although she skews closest to the comics version.

            "negative6": "So the idea of seeking revenge to protect your family, or to redeem the death of your loved ones, is something that I think resonates with the two of them. Adrianna was like Tomb Raider meets Indiana Jones. And so it was important not only to show just her toughness and her ability in that sense but also her vulnerabilities and the softness in her. Because she does, kind of, become the Black Adam Whisperer. To watch that transition happen and to see how they affect each other in that space was also important.”   Adrianna may not be able to shoot electricity through her eyes yet, but if Black Adam gets sequels to continue the story, that day may be coming. Isis has powers akin to Black Adam’s (superstrength, energy manipulation, flight, etc.) and control over all of the elements. Her future powers may mirror Black Adam’s but in this movie, it is the commonality of loss that unites this unlikely pair.  Vengeance is not something Steve Rogers would condone, but revenge has a long history in the world of comic book superheroism. Ghost Rider, Punisher, Deadpool, and more antiheroes have brought about positive change through grim acts of retaliation, and it sounds like Black Adam and Adrianna Tomaz are joining the cause.",
            "negative7": "Tomaz and Adam joined forces with the Justice Society to save Tomaz's son Amon from Gregor, who was seeking the crown, which he did, freeing the Legions of Hell, but Tomaz and the Kahndaqians fought back, freeing Kahndaq from oppression, and Adam began to protect the nation.  Adrianna Tomaz was born in Kahndaq at the time the country was under military occupation by foreign forces. In her childhood, she was told about the legend of Teth-Adam by her grandmother and was gifted a family heirloom made from Eternium. In her adulthood, she became a professor at Kahndaqi University and mothered a son who she named Amon. However, in 2021, Intergang took control of the country and oppressed her people, also exploiting the country's deposits of Eternium. It is also known that her husband was murdered by Intergang. As a result, she became a freedom fighter in hopes of eventually gaining freedom for her country.[2]  Tomaz receives a message from her insider. Tomaz was with her son Amon Tomaz making a long line to attend an event, until Amon complained for having waited so long while some Intergang soldiers jumped the line, so Adrianna told him about good things come to those who wait and that Kahndaq never learned from its past, until Karim arrived with two hamburgers to share with Amon.",
            "negative8": "Upon freeing her, Black Adam found her to be unafraid and highly vocal about how he could change his country for the better.  After weeks of discussion, during which Adrianna changed the way Adam looked at the world, Adam retrieved the magical amulet of Isis from the tomb of his wife and children, and asked Captain Marvel to confer its power on Adrianna. The Amulet of Isis had long ago belonged to another of the wizard Shazam's champions, Queen Pharoah Hatshepsut of the 15th Dynasty, who had used it to bring peace to her kingdom. Upon Hatshepsut's death the amulet became dormant.  Upon holding the amulet and speaking \"I am Isis\", Adrianna was transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess. She and Adam then began traveling the Middle East and freeing enslaved children, hoping to find Isis' kidnapped brother. In Week Sixteen of the series, Adam proposes to Isis and the two are wed by Captain Marvel, with several other Marvel Family members (Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., Tawky Tawny the tiger and Uncle Dudley) present as members of the wedding party. It is suggested that the presence of Isis is having a calming influence on Black Adam, transforming him from the ruthless dictator he was prior to her arrival into a more benevolent figure.  Adrianna finally locates Amon, who has been tortured and crippled by Whisper A'Daire for refusing to join Intergang.",
            "negative9": "Upon learning of Intergang’s successful assassination of Osiris, Isis seeks vengeance, but in an attempt to fight off their manifestation of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, she catches an infectious disease from Horseman Pestilence, perishing in her husband’s arms. Her last words are a rather bleak realization: she was in the wrong and never should she have tried to \"change\" Black Adam. Her dying wish is a bone-chilling command: Adam must avenge the two siblings’ death. One of the final illustrations in the 52 series depicts a helpless Adrianna stuck within the very jewelry she held so dear during her lifetime. A new series of comics titled The Dark Age, running from October 2007 to March 2008, follow Adrianna’s ultimate resurrection after a distraught Black Adam tries and fails to bring her back from the dead by reassembling the scattered pieces of the Amulet of Isis with the complete skeleton of Adrianna. One year has passed since the event of her death, and ultimately, a rotten corpse is roused from the ground, spewing hate at the grieving husband. Unbeknownst to him, said corpse does not really belong to Adrianna, since the real superhero is being held captive, fully resurrected, yet spellbound — in the most literal sense of the word. There is heavy implication that Adrianna is sexually assaulted by her captor, Faust, during this second period of captivity.",

Tomaz complains to the Justice Society for not having helped Kahndaq. As Tomaz was leaving, she was interrupted by Nelson who asked her to check her bag, getting upset with the Society for wanting to defeat Adam, berating them for not helping them when they were under coups for several years, claiming that Adam was a hero for saving the people of Kahndaq from repression and claiming not to have the Crown, but Hawkman explained that Adam was not a hero, which Tomaz did not believe, allowing them to check his bag without the Crown.  Tomaz learns of the truth about Teth-Adam.",

As a mother, Tomaz cares about her son, trying to teach him values such as patience and not wanting Adam to teach him to be violent, even giving the Crown of Sabbac to Gregor in order to save him.  During her classes, Tomaz showed that it was important to conserve even the worst relics in history, explaining that inaction against to outside influences can cause societies to languish and die, and that she would not give up on Kahndaq as she believed her people could be resourceful.

Tomaz soon lost communication with Amon, assuming that he had been kidnapped, so she disconsolately returned to her residence.[2]  Tomaz is consoled by Kent Nelson. While crying in the room for Amon, Tomaz was counseled by Kent Nelson about not suffering for her past by not being able to change it, asking her to focus on changing what still could, so Tomaz asked her to see the future to find out if they could to save her son, Nelson then calmed her down by asking her to trust them because Karim would live and save Amon, then seeing Teth-Adam break through another wall, reporting that he didn't find Amon.

Teth-Adam was ambushed by the Justice Society, who sought to stop him, starting a battle against him. During the battle, Tomaz stayed watching the fight, until seeing that Amon went to help Adam after he was knocked down, so he had to follow him to protect him, watching with happiness as Adam got up before Doctor Fate's attack.

In the mountains, he is forced to eat his servant Hassan who offers himself to Black Adam. He fails to notice that he has dropped one of her fingers and her ring at the tomb. He resurrects Isis using the Lazarus Pit. Her resurrection is short lived, as Adam is forced to kill Isis again upon seeing her new body rotting away as soon as she has come back to life.

Faust reveals that it is Isis' amulet that can revive her, and that Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. broke it into four parts and scattered it across the globe.

He was cunning enough to fool Adrianna’s family and provoke Teth-Adam’s wrath, and was willing to harm/kill Karim and Amon to get what he wants,  As a descendant of the tyrannical Ahk-Ton, Ishmael believed himself entitled to the crown of Sabbac and the throne of Kahndaq, deeming the Council of Wizards thieves who impeded on his “birthright”. Ultimately, he was a despicable excuse for a human being in whom even the Justice Society saw no value in his life and had to allow Teth-Adam to destroy Ishmael both times.

The film will be out on October 21, 2022. Although there has been a trailer and a comic-con teaser, there has been very little news about the villain or who will play the role either.  While Sabbac hasn't been officially confirmed as a part of Black Adam, merchandise leaks gave a first-look of the satan-like figure which confirmed his appearance in the film. With Sabbac having a few things similar to the Man in Black, let's take a look at the character from the comics and how he might tie into the film's story. Sabbac is definitely a huge villain for Black Adam and Shazam himself as well. The character has several similarities with how he commences his powers as compared to theother two and that makes him an incredibly formidable opponent.  Created by Judd Winick and Tom Raney, Sabbac first appeared in Outsiders Vol 3 #8 back in March, 2004. With the toy leaks mentioning Ishmael Gregor, we will be following his version of the characters from the comics who happened to be the second Sabbac.

While he initially appeared to be a loyal citizen of Kahndaq who would gladly join Adrianna's resistance, in truth Ishmael had been acting as Intergang's mole the entire time. He feels no hesitance about killing his countrymen, even deciding to shoot Amon who was no older than 13.   Ishmael is driven solely by the urge to reclaim his lost heritage and become the new tyrant of Kahndaq, even allying himself with demonic forces that would bring Armageddon.  Despite him being power hungry, he's a good actor, intelligent and expert leader, as he manipulated Adrianna to gain her trust to find the crown of Sabbac, not blowing any cover and faked his death, he also found out that the only way to be Sabbac is to get killed by Teth-Adam using his magic so he could be transported to Hell as mentioned by Adrianna.",

Sabbac proclaimed himself the king of Kahndaq until Adam and Hawkman joined forces to kill him, where Gregor was split in half.  Ishmael Gregor was born in Kahndaq.

Thanks to the Black Adam trailers, we've gotten a look at Sabbac, a character who appears to be the main villain of the film. But who exactly is Sabbac, and what makes him a force powerful enough to take on Black Adam and the Justice Society? Here's what you need to know about this very old and very dangerous DC villain. These are the topics we cover here: There have been several villains to call themselves Sabbac in the DC Universe, but all of them share the same power source. Just as Shazam and Black Adam draw strength from six powerful gods, Sabbac is empowered by six of the worst demons in the DCU. Sabbac's mortal host need only speak its name to transform into a super-strong, fire-breathing demon capable of going toe-to-toe with the world's most powerful heroes. Black Adam may think of himself as a god among men, but even his power is dwarfed by Sabbac.  Much like Shazam, Sabbac's name is an acronym for the six demons who grant him his powers.",

Ibac is also a mortal human (in this case a criminal named Stanley Printwhistle), who gains powers from a patron demon. Printwhistle sells his soul to Lucifer in exchange for the stamina of Ivan the Terrible, the durability of Cesare Borgia, the strength of Attila the Hun and the endurance of Caligula.  The main difference between the two characters is that Ibac is mainly a foe of the older Shazam/Captain Marvel, whereas Sabbac started out as a Captain Marvel, Jr. villain. Ibac has mostly faded from the spotlight in the contemporary DC Universe, though Johns and Frank's Shazam reboot depicts him as an evil tyrant who was defeated by Black Adam thousands of years ago. It's also worth pointing out that Sabbac is not the same characetr as Trigon, despite having a similar characetr design and penchant for world domination.

After finding himself adrift in the Quantum Leap machine with no way home, Dr. Beckett resolved to put things right that once went wrong… hoping that his next leap would be the leap home. Quantum Leap joins several other series to be given a second chance, though it seems that for every terrific and twisted Twin Peaks-level continuation, there's a disappointing Heroes Reborn.

Some models are just $50 shy of hitting the recommended list price of the 4090 — by default, without any scalper tax. It almost feels like people would just rather buy the RTX 4090 instead. Having looked at the eBay sales numbers for both GPUs, I can tell you one thing — the RTX 4090 doesn’t seem to have slowed down just because the RTX 4080 launched. On the contrary, it benefited from the release. While the RTX 4080 appears to be selling at a snail’s pace and scalpers are desperate to get rid of it, the 4090 thrives, and it’s still a catch at MSRP. Considering the vast chasm of performance between the two, the 4090 remains a better deal if caught at the recommended price of $1,600, however expensive that might be.",

The RTX 4090 will not be the fastest Lovelace-based GPU that Nvidia will release, it is going to use a cut-down version of the AD102, the best chip. Nvidia will also be saving the full-fat version later down the line. The reason why companies usually start on the highest-end of cards is that they are able to then do something named “chip binning”. So, if a chip is made and doesn’t quite cut the mustard to become 4090, then it might be put into a pile for use later in life as an RTX 4080 Ti later down the line. We’ve also seen rumors of an RTX 4090 Ti begin to circulate. But, those are just rumors for now. You certainly will not be disappointed if you pick one up and your CPU is more than up to the task of keeping up with a behemoth of a GPU such as this.  It’s important to note that we are talking about the desktop-class RTX 4090. For laptops, the RTX 4090 is actually similar in performance to an RTX 4070 Ti, though it comes slightly shy of being as powerful as the desktop-class GPU.",

Of course, scalpers tried their luck with the new Ada cards too, and while they were successful with the 4090, it seems that their success with the 4080 has been moderate at best so far. We only really have sales data from eBay, but let’s see how these numbers compare. Since the launch of the RTX 4090 on October 12, a total of 3,050 units have been sold through the U.S. version of eBay, at an average price of $2,328. It’s barely worth it to resell these cards right now. Around the time of the RTX 4080 launch (November 16), the sales of the 4090 started rising and have been on a steady, albeit slow, rise ever since. The prices are now close to what they were around the time of launch. The RTX 4080 is not doing so well. Only 281 units have been sold since November 16, at an average price of $1,496. For scalpers, this means that the sales are just about enough to break even when you consider shipping and fees.",

If you look at the RTX 4080 alone, regardless of the price, it is a really good graphics card. It outperforms every GPU from the previous generation, including the RTX 3090 Ti, by a considerable amount. The sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what gamers truly think. It’s also around 30% slower than the RTX 4090 while only being 25% cheaper, and this is where things get complicated, because, at MSRP, the RTX 4090 is a much better deal than the 4080 — even if it’s more expensive. It offers much better performance per dollar, which historically hasn’t been the case. The flagships were aimed at enthusiasts who didn’t try to get the best deal; they just wanted the best performance. Take one step down from the top and the good deals start, where the performance is still great but the price is less ridiculous. That hasn’t been true in this generation, and the sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what Nvidia’s customers think about this.

Now, the question is, was this Nvidia’s plan all along, or did it simply overestimate the enthusiasm people would have for the 4080? Considering the fact that Nvidia is planning to strategically cut the MSRP of the RTX 4080 soon, it might be that it never intended for the 4080 to serve as a crutch for the sales of the 4090. Nvidia also has some serious competition on the horizon. AMD will soon be launching the next-gen Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, both of which are supposed to rival the RTX 4080, but at more reasonable prices — $999 and $899, respectively. With the upcoming price cut, the RTX 4080 might become a more worthwhile contender. For now, if you manage to spot the 4090 for $1,600, it is a better deal — but only if you can make use of it. If you’re a casual gamer, save your money and get the 4080 without worrying about benchmarks and comparisons. Personally, I’m still waiting for the 7900 XTX, and judging by the performance per dollar of the RTX 4080, I really have no regrets.",

Nvidia’s RTX 4090 is intensely powerful, but at the first glance, it’s hard not to call it overpriced. Spending upwards of $1,600 on a graphics card is a lot, especially if you consider that you can build an entire gaming PC for the same amount of money. Of course, the flagship RTX 4090 only sounds like a rip-off until you look at the $1,200 RTX 4080. Has Nvidia really managed to trick us into thinking that a $1,600 GPU is a great deal? When Nvidia first launched its Ada Lovelace flagship, the RTX 4090, and the reviews started pouring in, it was clear that the GPU was a real beast. It’s easily the best graphics card right now, and I dare say it will remain so until Nvidia eventually drops an RTX 4090 Ti, or perhaps even resurrects the Titan. The RTX 4090 blows other graphics cards out of the water, no questions asked. Based on our testing, it’s 68% faster than the 3090 Ti in 4K gaming, it unlocks DLSS 3, and despite previous warnings and wild speculations, it’s somewhat power efficient.",

If this is true, and the 4080 is still laying around at MSRP, then the community has truly spoken — people just don’t want those decent, but questionably priced RTX 4080s.

In addition, the usual crew of third-party vendors will release their own spins on the 4090, so look for versions to come from companies like Gigabyte, MSI and PNY. So what do you get for all that money? For starters, you get one of the biggest GPUs we've ever seen, built on Nvidia's Lovelace architecture and sporting 76 billion transistors. That's nearly three times the 28 billion transistors on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090, which translates to greater potential power. You also get 16,384 CUDA cores, which are basically parallel processors that run Nvidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture (the aforementioned CUDA). These are the workhorses which do the heavy lifting of rendering graphics on your PC, and the 4090 has nearly 6,000 more than the old Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090.  That means we should see significantly improved performance when gaming on a 4090, which can achieve boost clock speeds of 2.52 GHz.

The RTX 4090 smashes straight through the current-gen performance ceiling and soars into the clouds. It’s needless to say I was expecting the Lovelace flagship to be a powerhouse, but I actually had to double-check all of my benchmarks out of disbelief. The GPU swallowed our usual test game selection whole, and even ray tracing failed to make the goliath card choke.    Before we dive into the wonders of DLSS 3.0, it’s worth taking a look at the card’s raw abilities. The RTX 4090 effortlessly churns out over 130fps in Hitman 3, and it can almost maintain 4K 60fps with ray tracing turned on. Essentially, you’ll be able to enjoy UHD visuals, ultra settings, and maintain a perfectly playable frame rate without relying on an AI upscaler – something I’d classify as an incredible feat.    Total War: Warhammer 3 is another demanding release that’ll usually make GPUs break a sweat, but the RTX 4090 makes light work of the strategy game.

Today, two tests have been spotted, and they bode pretty well for the GPU. The RTX 3060, which is still a favorite among Nvidia users, might be around 20% slower than the upcoming Ada Lovelace model. Will the RTX 4060 become one of the best GPUs, or at least one of the most popular models in this generation? One might think that a GPU that costs over $40,000 is going to be the best graphics card for gaming, but the truth is a lot more complex than that. In fact, this Nvidia GPU can't even keep up with integrated graphics solutions. Now, before you get too upset, you should know I'm referring to Nvidia's H100, which houses the GH100 chip (Grace Hopper). It's a powerful data center GPU made to handle high-performance computing (HPC) tasks -- not power PC games. It doesn't have any display outputs, and despite its extensive capabilities, it also doesn't have any coolers. This is because, again, you'd find this GPU in a data center or server setting, where it'd be cooled with powerful external fans.

Thankfully, you probably won't need to upgrade your power supply if you plan to upgrade from a 3070 or 3080, with NVIDIA recommending a 700-watt PSU for the 12GB variant and a 750-watt power supply for its more powerful sibling. However, should you decide to buy a new PSU, you'll want to wait until more ATX 3.0 PSUs arrive later this year.

He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Nvidia is officially relaunching its “unlaunched” 12GB RTX 4080 graphics card as the RTX 4070 Ti. After accidentally posting specs for the RTX 4070 Ti over the weekend, Nvidia is making the GPU official today at the Consumer Electronics Show. Priced at $799 and available on January 5th, the RTX 4070 Ti looks set to take on AMD’s $899 pricing for its Radeon RX 7900 XT. This rebranded card is now $100 less than Nvidia had planned to launch the original 12GB version of the RTX 4080, and it comes after the company faced criticism over pricing and how much more powerful the 16GB counterpart was. Nvidia admitted in October that “having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing,” before saying it was pausing the launch of the 12GB RTX 4080. Rumors quickly followed suggesting Nvidia would relaunch the card as the RTX 4070 Ti. The RTX 4070 Ti is identical to what was planned for the 12GB RTX 4080. It ships with 7,680 CUDA cores, a 2.",
            "negative25": "However, the big sticking point would be to see if the GPU releases for MSRP, which many add-in board partners are not adhering to. So, while you can pick one up, the value proposition can get destroyed.  Looking for where to buy an RTX 4080? We’ve got you covered with links from numerous retailers across the US and beyond. Stock is beginning to stabilize, and some retailers have also been issuing minor discounts on the GPU in an effort to make it slightly more accessible to users.   The RTX 4080 was released on November 16, 2022. This came slightly before Black Friday. Though, in the months since launch, you should expect that the GPU should see some minor discounts, especially on “premium” models of the RTX 4080.   It has been previously rumored by tech YouTuber, Moore’s Law is Dead, that the 4080 would see a ‘paper launch’. This would effectively mean Nvidia has released the card to the public but would be in short supply.  After the RTX 4080’s release date, we saw a several months gap until the RTX 4070 Ti was launched in January, followed by the RTX 4070 in mid-April. The graphics card seems to generally be in stock at many retailers following its initial launch.",
            "negative26": "Even ahead of launch you can see AIB cards pushing towards the price of the RTX 4090. In fairness that's more prevalent in the UK than in the US, where there's more reasonable pricing.  Taking everything else out of the equation, the fact that Nvidia can lop so much of the GPU good stuff from its AD103 silicon and still perform at a level that's just a third lower than the far bigger AD102 core means it delivers what you'd want from the RTX 4080. It's fast, the GPU is impressively small (though the shroud is unfeasibly enormous), and I'm deeply in love with DLSS with Frame Generation.  It's just that $1,200 price tag that stings. Nvidia has a history of pricing cards purely according to performance rather than the actual underlying silicon. Looking back as far as the Kepler architecture and the GTX 680, the company has made performance and efficiency leaps and priced up nominally lower spec GPUs accordingly. As a business it's the right thing to do in a capitalist market. But when you're looking at the comparative specs of the RTX 4080, RTX 3080 Ti, and RTX 4090, it's tough not to think this is a GPU that shouldn't be priced at this prohibitive level.",
            "negative27": "If the RTX 4080 came out at $999 that would be a far more reasonable price given the cut-down silicon it's using and the relative 40-series performance. Throw in the spectre of a brutal macro economic climate and that feeling's only going to be compounded. At $999 the RTX 4080 would have been a great high-end gaming GPU, but the artificial RTX 3080 Ti price point, and 'unlaunched' 12GB version has backed the latest Ada card into the corner. At the moment it's got the 4K gaming performance against the previous gen, but if the RX 7900 XTX pushes it harder than expected, Nvidia may have to respond on pricing. But I wouldn't bank on it.

Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition hits stores today, lightning-fast performance and a massive new price tag in tow. While last generation’s awesome RTX 3080 cost $700 at launch, delivering a monument 60 to 80 percent performance uplift over its predecessor, this new model is releasing with a staggering $1,200 price tag. Yes, that’s right: a $500 (or 71 percent) increase over the cost of its predecessor. For roughly 30 percent more performance.  Sheesh.  We’ve been putting the GeForce RTX 4080 through its paces. While Nvidia’s new GPU is astonishingly fast, blowing past last gen’s RTX 3090 with ease while drawing much less power, that new price tag casts a long shadow over its release, to such an extent that we can’t even come close to recommending this card at this aggressively insulting price—unless, perhaps, if you’re using it for content creation below 8K resolution. Look for our comprehensive RTX 4080 gaming performance review to land in the coming days.

            "negative30": "As I've said earlier, Nvidia has pared the silicon back a whole lot to create the AD103 GPU in comparison to the AD102 chip of the RTX 4090. Generalising, it's 60% the size, has 60% of the transistors, and 60% of the CUDA cores, and yet is 75% of the price of the RTX 4090. If you wanted to do some simple maths the RTX 4080 really ought to be around $960. But thanks to the abortive decision to launch with a pair of RTX 4080 cards at $1,200 and $899 respectively—with different levels of memory and wholly different GPUs—Nvidia was locked into this price even once it unlaunched the cheaper 12GB card. I get the TSMC 4N process node is going to be a pricey one at the beginning of a new generation, but in terms of GPU yield alone, I'd be surprised if the manufacturing margins on the AD103 chip didn't start outstripping the GA102 relatively quickly. That's great for Nvidia, and excellent for its shareholders, but has little benefit for us PC gamers if it's going to maintain an almost artificially high pricing strategy.  As always, I would recommend the Founders Edition over any overclocked card.",
            "negative31": "The RTX 4090 remains a great option even at $1,600; it can max out a high-refresh rate 4K monitor and chew through content creation tasks without breaking a sweat, something no other GPU can claim, for just $100 more than the RTX 3090’s launch MSRP. It’s pricey, but good. The RTX 4080 is pricey but does nothing to justify its downright ludicrous cost. It does, however, manage to make both the RTX 4090 and the piles of older RTX 30-series cards look somewhat more reasonable thanks to the psychology of price anchoring. Nvidia and its partners are sitting on a massive stockpile of RTX 30-series GPUs after the cryptocurrency market crashed, and sunk demand for ultra-marked-up GPUs alongside it. Consider the RTX 3080: No one would expect to pay anywhere near its MSRP of $700 more than two years after its launch. But that’s where we’re at right now, and next to the $1,200 RTX 4080, it might look like a bargain, because the RTX 4080 is 71 percent more. Nvidia is keeping both these generations alive side-by-side for a reason. When Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang spoke to reporters after revealing Lovelace at GTC 2022, he said, “The idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.",
            "negative32": "The RTX 4090 was just $100 more than the RTX 3090, and not $500 more as is the case here. And let’s not forget the AMD RDNA3 RX 7900 cards, which will undercut all the 40-series cards. Back to the 4080 though, and price-wise, things become more complicated when analyzing the rumored price points for the upcoming card in the UK.  A total of three games were demonstrated at 2160p (4K) with the RTX 4080 according to official Nvidia benchmarks; Plague Tale: Requiem, F1 2022, and Microsoft Flight Simulator. We’ve chosen to focus on the latter as it is the most graphically demanding of the trio. As you can see, the 16GB variant averages just under 60 FPS natively, but that more than doubles with DLSS 3’s Performance mode. Best graphics card deals right now: Things get most interesting when comparing the two top-end Ada cards against themselves. According to this chart, there is around a 12.12% percent difference in performance power between the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090. That’s native performance, though, as things are almost identical with the A.I. supersampling – a mere 3.4% difference using DLSS 3, so things are close.",
            "negative33": "But while I feel that I've got all the data necessary to make a decision on how good a GPU the new Ada Lovelace card is right in this moment, I'm ultra-aware that moment isn't going to last long.  You could always argue the temporary nature of a GPU's initial success (or failure) is a regular issue with graphics card reviews; they can only ever exist as a snapshot in time in light of the inevitable changes that availability, pricing, and competition will wreak following any release. But this generation feels different to any other, and the RTX 4080 release more so. The struggle I'm having, you see, is that AMD (likely deliberately) announced its Radeon RX 7900 XTX just ahead of this GeForce release. And that is AMD's top GPU from this new generation, which is specifically targeting the RTX 4080, and not the Nvidia RTX 4090. Knowing that, it almost feels like I'm reviewing this card with just half the data I really need to be able to make a fully informed decision. As it is, I can probably extrapolate just enough from what little AMD has let slip officially to make a call. But it's still a bit of a stretch. What's also a stretch is any form of justification for the pricing of modern graphics cards.",
            "negative34": "This was the case with the RTX 3080 before it as the price-to-performance ratio was most competitive. With that said, we’re seeing a price hike of nearly 50% here between generations, so people may wait for the RTX 4070 instead. It remains to be seen.  The RTX 4080 is a three-slot design, although the actual dimensions of the cards will depend on individual partners and their own coolers. The RTX 4090 is also a three-slot design, so you may need to consider a new case for either card.  PC Guide is reader-supported.

It would make sense given the reduction in price and performance, and help to round out the series post-launch. However, it’s unlikely that we’ll see a third Ada card until at least early 2023.  It’s highly likely that the RTX 4080 will become the most sought-after of the Ada line.",
            "negative36": "But ray tracing, however you feel about it, is well on its way to being a ubiquitous lighting feature of modern games, and the older RDNA 2 architecture really suffers under the reflected glare. That should all make this a pretty easy recommendation, then. The RTX 4080 comfortably outperforms both the similarly priced cards from the previous generation, most notably the $1,200 RTX 3080 Ti, and therefore is really hitting that gen-on-gen performance uplift we crave. But neither GeForce card should ever have been a $1,200 GPU.  If you wanted to do some simple maths the RTX 4080 really ought to be around $960. I feel like the RTX 3080 Ti's pricing was a reaction to Nvidia missing out on cashing in on the unprecedented price hikes the RTX 3080 was seeing over and above the $699 MSRP the company launched it with. It seems to me that Nvidia wanted its piece of the silicon shortage/crypto boom action, and so the RTX 3080 Ti came out with a $1,200 price tag. And that has made it all too easy for Nvidia to match this almost artificial price point with its latest Ada card thanks to the fact it outperforms the last-gen GPU on all counts. Though at least the RTX 3080 Ti was still using a massive GA102 chip at its heart.",
            "negative37": "And then we come full circle to the point made at the beginning of this review; how will it stack up against the upcoming Radeon RX 7900 XTX? I can't help but feel we might be looking at a very close-run thing. I'm expecting the new AMD card to perform at a similar level to the RTX 3090, and for a $999 card that would make it tempting compared to a slightly quicker $1,200 RTX 4080, especially with its improved ray tracing capabilities. I think AMD will lose on performance for the most part but will sit comfortably lower in terms of pricing. But therein lies the rub. Though the $999 MSRP will come with the reference edition cards from AMD, and likely a few Sapphire and ASRock cards at launch, too, there will be myriad $1,000+ overclocked versions doing the rounds. Traditionally those pricier cards become the norm as initial launch stock runs dry. And when the prices of the RTX 4080 and RX 7900 XTX get close the decision between them will likely become anything but.  But let's lob in the inevitable premium priced products Nvidia's board partners will unleash post-launch, too. As always, I would recommend the Founders Edition over any overclocked card, and any MSRP version too. Factory overclocked GPUs simply aren't worth the ridiculous price premium attached to them.",
            "negative38": "8K is tough, but for $1,200 I would hope at this point to start to see higher VRAM capacities when Intel is handing out $350 Arc graphics cards with 16GB.” One of the perks of Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Founders Edition was its size. Virtually all custom 3080 boards by the likes of EVGA, Asus, MSI, et cetera were massive three- or four-slot cards that required lots of room in your PC case. The RTX 3080 Founders Edition stood out by being a standard two-slot card that fit into virtually any system, and it looked damned good doing it thanks to Nvidia’s stunning industrial design. Yay! Brad Chacos/IDG Not so with the RTX 4080 Founders Edition. Nvidia decided to give the RTX 4080 FE the same humongous triple-slot cooler as the RTX 4090 this time around, which means it’ll slip into far fewer systems. It’s a bit of a perplexing design choice, since the more efficient Lovelace-based RTX 4080 actually draws less power than the RTX 3080 FE under full load in our tests. Nvidia could’ve chosen a much cheaper, more manageable two-slot design yet again, I suspect—though having a huge, silent, and frigid three-slot cooler might help make you feel better about dropping $1,200 on this card I guess?",
            "negative39": "Either buy an RTX 4090 if you want no-compromises gaming and creation performance—or wait to see what Radeon offers this time around, or wait for Nvidia’s prices to potentially fall after it sells through that mountain of older RTX 30-series cards. Because a 71 percent (71 percent) price increase for a 30 percent performance increase ain’t it. That’s harsh, but it’s true. Stay tuned for our full gaming review soon.

            "negative40": "But AMD just revealed its next-gen “RDNA 3” Radeon GPUs and yes, they cost less than their predecessors. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX costs $999, compared to a $1,100 MSRP for the Radeon RX 6950 XT; the Radeon RX 7900 XT costs $899, compared to $999 for the Radeon RX 6900 XT (though the 7900 XT may have more in common with last-gen’s 6800 XT). We’ll have to see where performance falls when AMD’s cards launch on December 13, but if the Radeon RX 7900 XTX manages to hit the 1.5x to 1.7x uplift (via 6950 XT) that Radeon claims, Team Red’s offering could very well wind up just behind the RTX 4090 and as fast or faster than the RTX 4080 for hundreds of dollars less. Take all vendor-supplied benchmarks with a big handful of salt, but if the Radeon RX 7900 XTX is indeed more than 1.5x faster than the 6950 XT, it could wind up faster than the 4080 in traditional games for hundreds less. AMD Don’t be a sucker and pay $1,200 for this card. Don’t be a sucker and buy a 2-year-old last-gen model at full price.",
            "negative41": "During a time of extreme economic difficulty and uncertainty across the globe, it's not a great look for both the main GPU makers to reveal their next generation graphics cards with the starting price being $900 at best. There will be arguments the $1,200 RTX 4080's performance over and above the RTX 3080 Ti renders it an unqualified success. But I have thoughts on that, too.  I guess the highlight here is the fact this is the RTX 4080 16GB card, not the 'unlaunched' RTX 4080 12GB. But the key to why Nvidia ended up having to kill (however temporarily) the 12GB card lies not just in the amount of memory it sported, but the actual GPU makeup of the chip itself. This RTX 4080 16GB card is using the second-tier Ada Lovelace GPU, the AD103 chip. The 12GB card was set to use the AD104, which is a third-tier GPU, and realistically only suitable to go into an RTX 4070-series card, not some bastardised RTX 4080. Which I guess is where we're going to see it next pop up, either with or without the 'Ti' suffix.",
            "negative42": "By rights, it should be a pixel-pushing hero that offers premium performance for less than a 4090. While the latter is true, Nvidia’s latest 80-series card costs a chunk more than the RTX 3080 and 2080, and straying away from traditional pricing may prompt some enthusiasts to wait for the RTX 4070.    So, should you buy an RTX 4080? Well, if you’re feeling impatient, it’ll provide your machine with marvelous DLSS 3 superpowers. However, I feel like that particular group of frame-rate fuss pots have probably splashed out on an RTX 4090 already, and the rest are waiting to weigh up the entire Lovelace lineup.    Still, the RTX 4080 is an excellent next-gen option that throws a heavy 4K punch, so if you do give in to its questionable MSRP, you won’t feel cheated when it comes to raw performance, features, and AI-powered capabilities. That said, custom variants will likely cost even more, and your wallet will probably end up screaming either way.            The second Lovelace GPU is a 4K heavy hitter, but its price might hinder its popularity with some gaming PC enthusiasts.     \r                     Phil Hayton                 Phil is a PC gaming hardware expert.",
            "negative43": "If you use your graphics card for work as well as play, you’ll like what’s on offer here—maybe. Adam “EposVox” Taylor, the internet’s stream professor, already tested the RTX 4080’s workstation chops in a gauntlet of content creation benchmarks. Bottom line? The huge performance benefits he first witnessed in the RTX 4090 still hold true here, with the RTX 4080 (usually) smoking its last-gen predecessors in streaming, editing, AI art generation, and more. But there’s a catch: The RTX 4080 only comes with 16GB of onboard VRAM. That’s plenty for gaming, of course, but EposVox found it wanting for serious video editors. Check out his full eval for dozens upon dozens of benchmarks, but here’s the key excerpt on why you may want to spend up for a 4090’s 24GB capacity or wait for a cheaper RTX 40-series option instead: “Throwing the card in my Threadripper Pro build to text my intense 8K project full of 8K RAW footage, Resolve SuperScaled 4K footage, plugins and effects… unfortunately the 4080 couldn’t export this, just like the previous 80-tier cards I tested. 16GB of VRAM still isn’t enough, I suppose—plugins error out, color graded footage takes longer than the 4090, and so on.",
            "negative44": "Comparing these to the previous generation, the 4080 boasts nearly 1000 more CUDA cores than the 3080. However, while the specs comparing the two might be smaller in some aspects, the faster clock speed gives the 4080 an additional boost over their predecessors. According to reports, the Nvidia RTX 4080 is  ‘cut down in some capacity, offering a variation on the ‘full’ chip inside the planned Ti revision. In the keynote, Jensen Huang stated that they’d worked with fabrication facility TSMC – who produce a lot of chips for various companies – to build a 4nm process. This allows Nvidia to cram more onto the die housed within the 4080 to produce better results. Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more. You can check out RTX 4080 benchmarks in our review.  Leaker Kopite7Kimi, stated previously to expect the 4080 cards to benchmark around 15,000 in Time Spy Extreme. On the RTX 4080 16GB, Flight Simulator doesn’t exactly get much of a performance boost – but this could be tied in with the CPU being used. Meanwhile, the Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark goes off the graph with over 3x the performance and Darktide sees just under 2x the performance. According to Nvidia’s own metrics, the now-canceled 12GB model had a 2.",
            "negative45": "Yet, if you’re willing to ignore Nvidia’s questionable branding, the GPU is still a 4K heavy hitter that’ll boost fps further than an RTX 3090, and its remarkable DLSS 3 capabilities somewhat sweeten the deal.      Equipped with 16GB GDDR6X VRAM, the RTX 4080 is designed with 4K gaming in mind. It packs 9,728 CUDA cores, 1,024 less than the RTX 3090, and features faster 2,505MHz boost clock speeds.    Unlike the RTX 4090, Nvidia’s AD103 GPU isn’t as ravenous for power, thanks to its 320W TDP. That means you’ll be able to use the same 750W PSU that’s powering your RTX 3080, but you’ll still have to deal with an adapter.      In our RTX 4090 review, I called the Asus TUF gaming model an aesthetic nightmare, but Nvidia’s Founder’s Edition RTX 4080 design isn’t quite as offensive. It even provides a splash of subtle lighting, complete with a customisable RGB strip and an illuminated GeForce logo. Will it stand out at a LAN event? Probably not, but it helps prevent the card from looking like a dark obelisk lurking within your case.",

            "negative6": "I saw they sort of dumbed down these characters for kids and decided that was why it really wasn’t connecting. [Kids] should get a chance to meet the real Batman. So our Batman is the same cool Batman that everyone knows and loves. He does everything short of punching you in the face. It started with that and then we found the “Batwheels” as the characters who could be the kids and see the show through their eyes. Dar: Quite a few of the cast members have worked together whether it’s Xolo and Jacob on Cobra Kai or Xolo and Lilimar on Cleopatra in Space. Obviously the voice recording for this Batwheels cartoon was remote but I’m curious if you ever recorded together or if you knew who your co-stars were?  Lilimar: This one was a little bit more secret. I didn’t know who was who. None of us ever recorded together. Cleopatra was more fun in the sense that we could do group sessions. With this one, I had no idea who was on the show until they announced it. Simon J. Smith: We had one table read where we had 25 people on the Zoom and everybody could see each other for the first time. Lilimar: I found out Xolo was on it later because they mentioned it casually, “We have this one guy. His name is Xolo Maridueña.” Jacob Bertrand: This guy?",

In October 2020, it was announced that an animated preschool series centered around the Batmobile was in development at Warner Bros. Animation, set to premiere on Cartoon Network's then-upcoming preschool block Cartoonito and HBO Max.[1] According to Tom Ascheim, president of the now-defunct Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics, the series was greenlit due to its concept being fit for the studio's focus on preschool projects.[1] Michael G. Stern serves as developer and co-executive producer, with Simon J. Smith as supervising producer, and Steven Fink and Caroline Karmel producing.[11][12] Stern was brought into the project early in development, as WB explored ideas for preschool-oriented DC shows, while Smith was brought after Stern wrote the first scripts for the series.[13] In December 2022, the series was renewed for a second season, with Stern and Smith being promoted to executive producers.[14]",

Lilimar: For me it was The Dark Knight. I didn’t see a lot [of Batman] growing up until I moved to the states. Dark Knight was my introduction.

In order to accomplish this, they tested the personalities for each character with a test group, who received the characters positively.[13] The writers also wanted to avoid portraying the Legion of Zoom as mere copies of their owners, to which they gave each vehicle their own characteristics, such as portraying Prank, the Joker's van, as \"a surfer dude\".[13]  The series' score was composed by Alex Geringas, while the theme song was performed and produced by Andy Sturmer,[12] who previously composed the themes for the series The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold.

Before that, she served as Environment Secretary and Justice Secretary. Truss is seen as a libertarian, and has pledged to cut taxes despite some economists warning the move could send inflation — which is already hovering around a 40-year high in Britain — even higher, as the U.K. teeters on the brink of recession.

Britain faces serious economic challenges and needs stability and unity, Sunak said on Monday in his first public speech since winning the contest. “There is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” Sunak said. “We now need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.” Sunak, a former finance minister, has been left with the task of steering a deeply divided country through an economic downturn set to make millions of people poorer. Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, reporting from London, said Sunak is “pretty well placed” despite the challenges ahead. “In some ways, … some of his work has already been done in terms of putting out the fires that Liz Truss created because it did cause a storm in the markets,” Simmons said.",

            "evidences2": "Liz Truss officially became Britain's new prime minister on September 6, 2022 Tuesday after Boris Johnson formally resigned to Queen Elizabeth II at her home in Balmoral, Scotland, and the monarch accepted Truss as the new leader, inviting her to form a government. The process was largely a formality, to make official the results of an internal power struggle in one of Britain's main political parties. Johnson's three-year tenure was peppered with scandals, which eventually resulted in his ouster. So, who is the woman the Conservative Party has chosen to replace him? Like Johnson, 47-year-old Truss is a member of Britain's Conservative party. She has served as a member of the British Parliament for 12 years and held cabinet roles within various Conservative governments for eight years, serving most recently as Foreign Secretary. Before that, she served as Environment Secretary and Justice Secretary. Truss is seen as a libertarian, and has pledged to cut taxes despite some economists warning the move could send inflation — which is already hovering around a 40-year high in Britain — even higher, as the U.K. teeters on the brink of recession.  She takes over the premiership as the country faces that, and a number of other significant challenges, including sky-rocketing energy prices driven by the war in Ukraine."

            "positive1": "After receiving consumer pushback from raising its subscription prices, Netflix rolled out its newest tier: Basic with Ads, in November 2022. The ads tier subscription is $6.99 per month – almost 55% lower per month than its Standard subscription. While the monthly cost is lower for consumers, the newest tier comes with hidden price tags. In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand – when will this show up in a user’s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from  The Verge, a user’s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers. The second nuance with Netflix Basic with Ads tier comes from what shows and movies are offered at this level. Similar to the unpredictable ad experience, the available titles on the Basic tier seems extremely scattered without a rhyme or reason.",

Like its competitors, the price of Netflix varies depending on which subscription tier and features you choose. Netflix plans start at $7 a month, but to get the best video quality without ads you have to pay $20 a month. And due to Netflix's recent crackdown on password sharing in the US, it now costs an additional $8 a month to add an extra user to your account. The fee will only apply to users who live outside of an account holder's household. This year, Netflix announced another major change to its subscriptions: After 25 years, the streaming service is shuttering its DVD-rental services in September — an early part of Netflix's history that became synonymous with its red envelopes. The platform also recently removed its ad-free Basic plan, which means the its cheapest ad-free plan now starts at $15.49 a month. To help you decide which Netflix plan is right you, we've put together a guide detailing how much Netflix charges for each of its membership tiers. Netflix currently offers three streaming plans: Standard with Ads, Standard, and Premium, starting at $7 a month and ending at $20 a month.

(Seriously, how the hell are there two GameStonk documentaries?) In short, Netflix isn’t something I want to spend $240 on each year anymore — its salad days are a distant memory — and the company is finally starting to empathize with my reasoning. Basic With Ads is functionally identical to Netflix’s $10 Basic plan. You’re capped at a 720p resolution for all of your playback options and are allowed to use only one device on the subscription at a time. (So no, you can’t engineer some sort of weird multi-apartment Bridgerton marathon.) The only sacrifice you need to make to get the $3 discount is to sit through the four minutes of total advertising time that occupied, say, season one, episode two of Stranger Things, which I fired up on my Roku for a test-drive. (Yes, I’m a little late to the Upside Down party.) The first thing I saw on my television was a dewy, luxurious promo for Louis Vuitton, which frankly read as a pointed barb to my newfound money-saving mind-set. Yes, Netflix believes that even those pivoting to Basic With Ads can afford the good life.",

Users on Netflix's cheapest plan will also lose the ability to download shows and movies to their devices for offline viewing. The main difference will come during the viewing experience. Netflix says that viewers will get an \"average of 4 to 5 minutes of ads\" per hour of content. These ads will be either 15 or 30 seconds long, and will play at both the beginning of shows and films as well as throughout. Switching is simple, with reps for Netflix confirming to CNBC Make It that the process is the same as it has always been. Users need only sign into their account on a computer or smartphone and then search for \"Plan Details\" under their account settings.

Basic with Ads subscribers also won’t be able to download series and films to their devices for offline viewing, and won’t have access to about 5% to 10% of Netflix’s content catalog due to licensing restrictions. Peters said in October that the missing titles will be “a very small minority of viewing” that the company will work to reduce over time. Popular shows currently not available with Basic with Ads include Arrested Development, Friday Night Lights, The Good Place, House of Cards, Knight Rider, The Last Kingdom, The Magicians, New Girl, Peaky Blinders, Queen of the South, The Sinner, and Uncoupled, Variety reports. Movies include 28 Days, Blue Jasmine, The Butler, Casino Royale, The Hateful Eight, The Imitation Game, Made of Honor, Man on a Ledge, The Mist, Morbius, Oblivion, Phantom Thread, Quantum of Solace, Rambo, Robin Hood, Skyfall, and Steve Jobs.

            "negative9": "There are no late return fees with Netflix’s DVD rental plans, and you can hold onto discs indefinitely—but you’ll have to send it back if you want to rent another. Plus, receiving cool red Netflix envelopes in the mail every week can make you feel pretty special. The Netflix app can be installed and activated on as many devices as you like, but the number of simultaneous streams is limited depending on the package. Standard with ads allows two streams, as well as episode/movie downloads to two devices for offline viewing. Standard also allows two streams, and it downloads to two offline phones or tablets. Premium allows four streams, and it downloads to six offline phones or tablets. If you have a large household and want to keep the kiddies happy, Premium is probably the way to go. Netflix recommends a baseline of 3Mbps internet speed for SD viewing, 5Mbps for HD, and 25Mbps for 4K Ultra HD. We, on the other hand, recommend 25Mbps as the bare minimum for any type of internetting—life’s too short for buffering, people. The Netflix app is available on almost every streaming device there is—it even works on ancient Nintendo Wii consoles (although you won’t find it on the Nintendo Switch). Netflix’s Standard plans stream in 1080p HD. The Premium plan allows 4K Ultra HD streaming, which applies to Netflix originals and some acquired titles.",
            "negative10": "Same as Netflix, most other streamers reserve their 4K HDR streams for their ad-free subscribers, although that’s not a universal policy; Paramount+, for one, does allow ad-supported subscribers to stream in 4K. Netflix Standard with Ads subscribers will have to sit through 4-5 minutes of commercials per hour, with the ads running at the beginning and during videos. Each ad will be either 15 or 30 seconds. That 4-5 minute per hour figure is pretty much in line with Netflix’s competitors. For example, the “with ads” version of HBO Max averages about four minutes an hour, while Peacock tops out at about five minutes per hour.  It’s also worth noting that Netflix isn’t putting ads in children’s programming or in “new” Netflix Originals movies. Nope, not everything. Netflix licenses many of its movies and TV shows from third parties, including some Netflix Originals, and those agreements will need to be renegotiated before Netflix can insert ads into those videos for streaming.  According to Netflix chief operating officer Greg Peters, anywhere between 5 and 10 percent of programming on Netflix’s ad-free tiers will be unavailable for “with ads” users, although Peters says the streamer will “work to reduce that number over time.",

Given that Netflix is available in more than 190 countries, we’d expect Netflix Standard with Ads to debut in many more territories in the months ahead. Netflix lost subscribers during the first and second quarters of 2022, ending a decade of growth and sending Netflix’s stock price into a tailspin. And while Netflix is ubiquitous in North America, it’s having trouble gaining traction in the rest of the world, where it’s facing tough competition from cheaper streaming services. Meanwhile, Netflix’s rapidly growing competitors, including HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock, and Hulu, all have–or are preparing to roll out–their own cheaper ad-supported plans, all of which currently undercut Netflix’s cheapest ad-free plans. So while it wasn’t all that long ago that Netflix executives scoffed at the idea of cheaper ad-supported plans, the company abruptly changed course once it became clear that its once seemingly unstoppable growth had stalled.

            "negative12": "Depending on how you look at it, marketers could see this as: The newest Netflix price tier allows them to compete with other streaming services at a lower price. It’s an excellent strategic move on their part, and it opens up the OTT space for advertisers to get in front of users who may not use other streaming services. While the plan type is new, Netflix (as well as advertisers) should monitor user engagement closely and make any strategic pivots necessary to maximize engagement and subscriber growth. While Netflix ads are open to larger ad companies, I expect them to roll out an in-house advertising platform similar to Hulu sometime next year. Have you tried Connected TV/OTT ads yet?

            "negative13": "As for the ad breaks themselves, they all seem to be composed of two or three commercials, of a range between 60 and 90 seconds. There’s no countdown timer allowing you to skip through them — you can’t get out that easily — but you can pause them midstream. (Any muting you do will also need to be manual.) The ads come on at the same volume as whatever you’re already watching, a policy that should be adopted throughout the broadcast industry. I had the same experience on both my laptop and my phone, which again delivered an episode of Big Mouth paired with a hilariously incongruous Louis Vuitton ad. Whether you have the patience for all these ad breaks is probably a personal matter. It should be said that I am a budget-streamer adherent. My girlfriend and I have been steadily making our way through all of Mad Men, which is inexplicably streaming free of charge on an anonymous VOD service called Freevee. The dulcet anxiety of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce is frequently interrupted by hard cuts to commercials, but you would be amazed at how quickly you stop noticing the interruptions. Will the Basic With Ads plan usher in a Netflix renaissance? Who knows? But the service is gaining subscribers again after an extended fallow winter: 2.4 million users signed up in this past quarter, and many of them are spending less money on the service than ever. That’s the best Netflix can hope for.",
            "negative14": "The restriction shouldn’t come as a surprise to users, as Netflix announced this back in July. Titles that aren’t available for Basic users will show a red padlock, indicating that it is restricted. The red padlock seems to be a passive “Call to Action” because users can click on the padlocked title, which takes them to an upgrade screen. I theorize that Netflix’s subscriber strategy is to entice new users to the service or get previous subscribers to come back at a Basic price level. This can help grow and scale their subscriber numbers after tumbling since increasing prices. Once a user is in, restricting titles that may be a “must have” for users attempts to show users the value of upgrading. Connected TV ads aren’t new to consumers. Brands spent over $400 million in ads on Hulu alone in 2021. In economic uncertainty, consumers may be willing to sacrifice their viewing experience to include ads while trying to save money. But if the viewing experience dwindles, consumers may be less inclined to engage with Connected TV ads. While it’s too early to tell about Netflix Basic with Ads, a common gripe from consumers on other streaming services is the lack of variety in ads. Back in 2021, Morning Consult conducted a poll to consumers about their experience with streaming services ads. According to the survey: So, what does this mean for advertisers?",

With Netflix’s new password-sharing policies, ad-supported subscribers won’t be able to share their account outside of their household.

Among the missing movies are Skyfall, 28 Days, The Imitation Game, and The Bad Guys. That’s starting to change, however. As of March 2023, The Crown was available for streaming on Netflix with ads, among other previously unavailable titles. If you do run across a video that’s unavailable on the Netflix Standard with Ads plan, you’ll see a padlock on the title, or a “Change plan to watch” banner in place of the standard “Play” button. One of the best perks offered by the big streamers is the ability to download their videos for offline viewing, perfect for binge-watching your favorite series during a long flight or when you don’t want to bust through your data cap. Unfortunately–but not surprisingly–Netflix won’t let Standard with Ads subscribers download videos for offline viewing.

None of the ad breaks felt particularly oppressive — in fact, I tend to enjoy a 30-second interval when I’m allowed to check my phone. Across the board, Netflix appears to be using a light touch with this new monetization stream. I jumped into the eminently watchable Molly’s Game after finishing my adventure in Hawkins, Indiana, and noticed that only five ad breaks were pockmarking the playback. Not bad for a movie with a two-hour, 20-minute runtime. (This is extremely off-topic, but it needs to be said that if Molly’s Game were 100 minutes long, it would have won Best Picture.) More surprising, I found no commercials whatsoever as I examined The Irishman, which led me to assume that the gargantuan scope of the film had broken the algorithm. (I was almost bummed because it would be pretty funny to watch Netflix’s most vaunted original production as if it were broadcasting on TNT.)

Even so, the company still offers a basic plan without ads – but that may not last long. In Canada, Netflix has now quietly killed this tier, forcing users to subscribe to the ad-based plan or pay more for higher tiers. As reported by BlogTo (via TechCrunch), Netflix’s website in Canada no longer shows the basic plan without ads as an option for new subscribers. The company didn’t provide details about whether this is a permanent decision or what will happen to current subscribers of the tier that has supposedly now been discontinued. In most countries, Netflix currently has four different subscription plans: Basic with ads, Basic, Standard, and Premium. Basic plans only offer 720p content for a single device, while Standard has 1080p video and works with up to two devices simultaneously. Premium, the most expensive tier, is the only one with 4K content and support for up to four different devices. With the latest change in Canada, the “Basic with ads” plan has been rebranded as “Standard with ads.” Just like the original Standard tier, the new one with ads supports up to two devices simultaneously and 1080p content instead of 720p. The plans cost $5.99, $16.49, and $20.99 per month, respectively.",

This means that customers willing to have an ad-free experience will now have to pay an extra $10.50 at least instead of $4. I am here in Canada and have been paying for four different devices for years for my family. I do not actually need 4K, but it is included in the plan. The thing I find hard to understand is why these four devices have to be in the same house. This seems completely arbitrary.  I pay for Apple services and by items from the App Store and they  are good on multiple devices no matter where they are located and this seems fair to me.  The moment I get an email asking me to pay more is the moment I am no longer a Netflix customer. It’s uncertain whether Netflix plans to discontinue the basic plan without ads in other countries, but it seems likely. A few months ago, the company updated its website to hide the basic plan without ads for new customers in some regions. It remains available there, but you have to look for a really small link on the Netflix website to get it. Netflix’s strategy comes at a time when the streaming market is oversaturated with dozens of options available, and most of them cheaper than Netflix. This has caused many people to switch to other platforms such as Disney+, Max, and even Apple TV+.",
            "negative27": "Not long after the company first indicated publicly it was open to an ad-supported tier in April, it said in July that it was \"targeting to launch ... around the early part of 2023.\" But then reports said Netflix moved up the launch date to better compete with Disney Plus' own ad-tier launch in December.  In the US, Basic with Ads is $7 a month, a savings of $3 monthly compared with the cheapest ad-free membership. That's cheapest Netflix has every offered a stand-alone streaming subscription in the US.   By comparison, in the US: A full, country-by-country price rundown for Basic with Ads is at the end of this article.  No, Netflix isn't increasing the prices of its existing plans.  It's a reasonable question: Disney Plus is going to hike prices for its existing ad-free membership when it launches an ad-free tier Dec. 8.  In the past, Netflx has bumped its prices higher roughly every two years, but lately it has sped up the pace: Its last price hike in the US was announced in January, which was barely more than one year after the previous one. This quicker cadence may feel like a warning of more hikes to come, but every time Netflix raises prices, it also has to deal with what's known as churn, or the rate of cancellations.",
            "negative28": "And as they rolled out, they introduced features that have now become the norm customers expect, including an option to pay less if you watch ads.  Nearly every one of Netflix's new competitors offers a cheaper tier with advertising. (The lone holdout besides Netflix, Apple TV Plus, is reportedly considering ads, too.) Now Netflix, grappling earlier this year with its first membership declines in a decade, has reversed course to add advertising as well.  Here are the biggest things to know.  Starting this week, Netflix began running ads alongside its streaming shows and movies for the first time, but only in select countries and only if you subscribe to a new tier called Basic with Ads. If you want to keep watching Netflix without advertising, the service still has the same ad-free memberships.  If you're already a Netflix subscriber who has never seen ads, you still won't. But if you want to pay less for Netflix every month in exchange for sitting through ad breaks during your streaming, you can sign up for a new Basic with Ads account.  The new Basic with Ads membership option has been launching this month across 12 countries. It started with rollouts in Canada and Mexico on Tuesday. Thursday, the new tier went live in the US, Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea and the UK. Next, it will widen to Spain on Tuesday, starting at 9 a.m. PT.",
            "negative29": "By clicking on \"Plan Details,\" you can select \"Change Plan.\" If you don't see the option for Basic with Ads, it's possible that you have Netflix through a third-party billing partner or with a package -- you'll need to contact that provider to confirm whether the ad-supported plan is available.  If you still can't find Basic with Ads, you may be using an incompatible device -- a few devices won't stream Netflix if you have a Basic with Ads account. Apple TV, for example, doesn't support streaming on the new, cheaper tier. Neither does Playstation 3, although PS4 and PS5 do. Netflix has a support page with some guidance by device.  Netflix said it will average no more than four to five minutes of advertising each hour. Ad breaks will happen both before your program starts (known as preroll) and in the middle of your programming at a scene change (known as midroll). Netflix is aiming to have \"some very tight frequency caps so that members don't see the same ad repeatedly,\" Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said. By comparison, when HBO Max launched its ad-supported tier last year, it said its ad load would be less than four minutes per hour. Disney Plus has said that it's aiming to average four minutes of advertising per hour for its coming ad-supported tier, too. And Peacock, when it was preparing for its launch, said its ad-supported tiers would have five minutes of ads per hour.",
            "negative30": "Generally, Netflix has characterized its churn after a price increase as manageable, calling it an \"adjustment period\" of \"slightly higher churn.\" But with Netflix so spooked by its existing membership declines so far -- including some cancellations this year that were prompted by the latest price increase -- the company is unlikely to tempt fate by raising prices again so soon.  Last month, Netflix confirmed its existing tiers will stay the same price.  Until now, Netflix had three tiers of subscriptions at different prices, all of them ad-free: Basic, Standard and Premium. In select countries, including the US, Netflix now has four tiers:  The Standard and Premium plans are unchanged. The ad-free Basic tier has one change: With the launch of Basic with Ads, the ad-free Basic tier is getting bumped up to a higher video image quality -- both Basic and Basic with Ads are getting 720p HD quality video, after HD was previously reserved for Standard subscriptions.  Once the new tier is live in the country where you live, you can either sign up for it as a new member or switch your existing subscription to the cheaper tier.  If you're a new Netflix member, you can sign up for the Basic with Ads plan as you would for any other Netflix plan as soon as the new tier goes live in your country.  If you are already a Netflix subscriber, you can switch your plan to Basic with Ads by logging into your Netflix account.",

The amount of titles locked out from ads-supported members is roughly 5% to 10% of the library, varying by country, according to the company. No. Basic with Ads membership cannot download to watch offline at all.  If they watch on a Kids profile, they won't -- Kids profiles won't run any advertising.  The monthly price for Basic with Ads varies depending on where you live: To verify the pricing of all tiers in your country, Netflix's plans and pricing page has a drop-down menu at the top that lets you choose which country's prices to display.",
            "negative32": "There are no late return fees with Netflix’s DVD rental plans, and you can hold onto discs indefinitely—but you’ll have to send it back if you want to rent another. Plus, receiving cool red Netflix envelopes in the mail every week can make you feel pretty special. The Netflix app can be installed and activated on as many devices as you like, but the number of simultaneous streams is limited depending on the package. Standard with ads allows two streams, as well as episode/movie downloads to two devices for offline viewing. Standard also allows two streams, and it downloads to two offline phones or tablets. Premium allows four streams, and it downloads to six offline phones or tablets. If you have a large household and want to keep the kiddies happy, Premium is probably the way to go. Netflix recommends a baseline of 3Mbps internet speed for SD viewing, 5Mbps for HD, and 25Mbps for 4K Ultra HD. We, on the other hand, recommend 25Mbps as the bare minimum for any type of internetting—life’s too short for buffering, people. The Netflix app is available on almost every streaming device there is—it even works on ancient Nintendo Wii consoles (although you won’t find it on the Nintendo Switch). Netflix’s Standard plans stream in 1080p HD. The Premium plan allows 4K Ultra HD streaming, which applies to Netflix originals and some acquired titles.",
            "negative33": "Netflix last month introduced a new ad-based plan in an attempt to attract more subscribers, since this tier is a bit less expensive than the others. And the company seems to be really determined to force users to watch ads or spend more to get rid of them, as the cheapest ad-free plan has been hidden from its website. As noted by Tecnoblog, the Netflix website no longer shows the basic ad-free plan to some users when they try to subscribe to Netflix. Instead, the only options available are the Basic with ads, Standard, and Premium plans. 9to5Mac can also confirm that Netflix is indeed hiding the cheapest ad-free plan from its website. But that doesn’t mean that Netflix has discontinued the basic ad-free plan. There’s still a way to choose that tier, but it’s now hidden in a really small link on the Netflix subscription page. Some users can still see the four plans in the list without having to click on any links, so it seems that the company is running some sort of A/B test. Tecnoblog explains that Netflix is probably using dark pattern practices to make users choose between a less advantageous option and other more expensive ones. This can be considered a dark pattern, the name given to the practice of luring the user into less interesting or advantageous options. Apparently, the intention is to push those who don’t want a plan with advertises to a much more expensive plan. In the US, the Basic plan with ads costs $6.",
            "negative34": "Like its ad-free Basic plan, Basic with Ads has a lower video quality than Netflix’s Standard and Premium plans. Basic with Ads subscribers also won’t be able to download series and films to their devices for offline viewing, and won’t have access to about 5% to 10% of Netflix’s content catalog due to licensing restrictions. Peters said in October that the missing titles will be “a very small minority of viewing” that the company will work to reduce over time. Popular shows currently not available with Basic with Ads include Arrested Development, Friday Night Lights, The Good Place, House of Cards, Knight Rider, The Last Kingdom, The Magicians, New Girl, Peaky Blinders, Queen of the South, The Sinner, and Uncoupled, Variety reports. Movies include 28 Days, Blue Jasmine, The Butler, Casino Royale, The Hateful Eight, The Imitation Game, Made of Honor, Man on a Ledge, The Mist, Morbius, Oblivion, Phantom Thread, Quantum of Solace, Rambo, Robin Hood, Skyfall, and Steve Jobs. To change your Netflix plan to Basic with Ads, hover over your profile icon in the top right corner of Netflix’s home screen, and then select “Account” in the dropdown menu that appears. Next, click “Change plan” in the “Plan Details” section of the page and select Basic with Ads.",
            "negative35": "The streaming service has a new option to catch shows and movies with advertising, at the cheapest membership price yet.    For years, Netflix dismissed the notion of advertising on its service. Even Eleven's obsession with Eggo waffles on Stranger Things was a creative choice, not a paid placement.  The era of Netflix with advertising is here. Thursday marked the launch of Netflix's cheaper, ad-supported tier in the US and eight other countries, after it rolled out in Canada and Mexico on Tuesday. The world's biggest subscription video service, Netflix grew into a behemoth partly thanks to its strategy of making shows and movies available in ad-free binges. Back when traditional, commercial-packed TV was the main way people watched, Netflix pitched itself as the alternative that wouldn't interrupt the flow of your programming with advertising, nor would it make you wait week to week to watch your next episode. Building itself into a giant by going against the grain of the TV industry, Netflix spent years dismissing the notion of advertising on its service.  Fast forward to today: Netflix is the one behind the times. Nearly all of Hollywood's major media companies have launched their own streaming services to take on Netflix, including Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Peacock and Paramount Plus.",

We could complain about the isolated nature of Netflix, as it offers less and less from outside film and TV studios all the time, concentrating more on its own product.

The ads tier subscription is $6.99 per month – almost 55% lower per month than its Standard subscription. While the monthly cost is lower for consumers, the newest tier comes with hidden price tags. In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand – when will this show up in a user’s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from  The Verge, a user’s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers. The second nuance with Netflix Basic with Ads tier comes from what shows and movies are offered at this level.

Like its competitors, the price of Netflix varies depending on which subscription tier and features you choose. Netflix plans start at $7 a month, but to get the best video quality without ads you have to pay $20 a month. And due to Netflix's recent crackdown on password sharing in the US, it now costs an additional $8 a month to add an extra user to your account. The fee will only apply to users who live outside of an account holder's household. This year, Netflix announced another major change to its subscriptions: After 25 years, the streaming service is shuttering its DVD-rental services in September — an early part of Netflix's history that became synonymous with its red envelopes. The platform also recently removed its ad-free Basic plan, which means the its cheapest ad-free plan now starts at $15.49 a month.

            "negative8": "It’s the type of series that may make you second-guess any of your intended vacation plans. 2022 was truly the year when the wealthy were held accountable, at least in movies and television. Between Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, White Noise, and Triangle of Sadness, we got a ton of great content that forced the upper class to have traumatic vacations. The pinnacle of this was the second season of The White Lotus, which moved the miniseries to a luxurious new location in Italy. Unfortunately for the characters, this had more in common with the Italian scenery of The Talented Mr. Ripley than it did with Under The Tuscan Sun. As with the first season, the end of this trip is teased at the very beginning, and it’s a violent one. Both seasons of The White Lotus take place at individual locations in a luxury vacation resort chain. A multitude of guests (most of whom are incredibly wealthy) interact with the staff and local residents, only to begin squabbling and bringing up past issues. While the show’s brilliance stems from the inventive storytelling of writer/director Mike White, it doesn’t hurt that the show has the budget and scale of an HBO production. In order to make the series as authentic as possible, White and his production team utilized several real locations in both seasons. The White Lotus has drawn critical acclaim due to how close its satire feels to reality, and the believability extends to the filming locations themselves.",
            "negative9": "Not every part of The White Lotus was shot on location, meaning an indoor or outdoor space that previously existed, but everything was in Italy.

Yes, you can stay at the Sicilian hotel from season two of ‘The White Lotus’ As much as you might dislike many of the – admittedly very dislikeable – characters of HBO’s breakout TV hit ‘The White Lotus’, there’s no denying the appeal of the show’s filming locations. The first season, which was set in Hawaii and revolved around the interactions between the guests and employees of a fictional resort chain, was full of spectacular backdrops and seriously enviable bits of luxury.",

However, creative design work on the part of White’s crew helped transform these real destination locations into the haunting environments of the series. It’s certainly the type of series that may make you second-guess any of your intended vacation plans. RELATED: The Craziest 'White Lotus' Season 2 Theories That Didn't Happen The first season of The White Lotus takes place in the Hawaiian resort, which is decorated and designed to reflect the local cultural practices (or at least the way that they are perceived by tourists); there’s a particularly entertaining storyline where the hotel manager Armond (Murray Bartlett) and the brutish guest Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) get into a dispute over the “Pineapple Room.” In reality, the Four Seasons Maui features one-bedroom suites that overlook Wailea Beach and cost over $9,000 a night. White had grown interested in telling a story set in Hawaii after filming episodes of his show Enlightened. He said that “the colonial legacy is still a living issue,” and that he learned more about the United States’ annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the lack of self-determination granted to Indigenous groups as a result of his experience.",
            "negative13": "The architecture in this part of the island’s north coast dates back to medieval times, and visitors here come to see the Norman cathedral as well as to stay at the popular beach resort.

            "negative14": "The Palm Suite is one of the resort’s Elite Oceanfront Suites, and it was completely redecorated for The White Lotus (although it wasn’t painted). If you’d like to get one over on Shane, who longs to rest his head in the premiere Pineapple Suite, you’ll want to look for the Lokelani Presidential Suite. At 4,500 square feet, with three bedrooms, five bathrooms and two living rooms, it is the largest suite in the resort, and in the entirety of Hawaii for that matter. Again, it was redecorated for The White Lotus, with plenty of pineapples thrown in for good measure. Steve Zahn and Connie Britton in the Tradewinds Suite Less conflicted by the size of her room, Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) stays in the Hibiscus Suite – one of the Four Seasons’ Oceanfront Prime Suites. Again, it was redecorated for the show. The Mossbacher family, again, are less conflicted by the size of their suite – other than the sartorial Olivia (Sydney Sweeney) insisting that her younger brother, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), sleep in the galley kitchen. In reality, the Maile Presidential Suite is much larger than The White Lotus gives it credit for, with three bedrooms, four bathrooms, and its own sauna.

            "negative16": "91] Some critics welcomed the characters Mia and Lucia, two Sicilian sex workers whose plot lines intersect with many of the hotel guests', saying their presence felt like a response by White to criticisms of the previous season's focus on its well-off leads.[89][92][93] Others noted how the second season \"has invested in horror imagery in a way the previous outing didn't, and it's been one of this installment's best through lines.\"[94]  Others thought the shift from the themes of class criticism to gender roles made for a less riveting watch.[93] Writing for Vulture, Roxana Hadadi said season two \"centers infidelity, to diminished effect\", and that \"there's also a new bluntness, and a noticeable tentativeness, that keeps this second season from hitting as hard and bruising as immediately as its predecessor.\"[92] Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson wrote season two is a \"vibrant set of plates to set spinning, which White does with his usual mix of acerbic bite and melancholy. Though, things do feel a little less pointed this season.\"[95] Shirley Li of The Atlantic noted \"Season 2 is as juicy as season 1, but it's not as caustic in its approach.",
            "negative17": "The new Four Seasons property for Season 2 is the San Domenico Palace in Taormina, a city on the Mediterranean island's northern coast—and like in Season 1, the resort is no motel.  The property boasts 111 suites, a spa, courtyards and gardens from the time of the monks, as well as a fine-dining restaurant and a pool-terrace diner. To top it off, the estate features an outdoor infinity pool, which has won over a considerable amount of screen time, per Condé Nast Traveler. The show's previous location in Hawaii at the Four Seasons Maui was a choice inspired by the fond childhood memories of director Mike White, and its new location bounces off of this. “The longer I spent time there, the more I realized just how complex it is,\" he said to The New Yorker in July 2021. \"And it just felt like that might be interesting as a backdrop to this show.\" On the southeast side of the island is the coastal area of Noto, where characters Harper Spiller (Aubrey Plaza) and Daphne Sullivan (Meghann Fahy) take an overnight ladies' trip to the town's Palazzo Ducezio in a series of revelatory and memorable new scenes. Cefalù, a coastal town on the island's north coast, also serves as a backdrop for many landscape shots featured throughout Season 2.",
            "negative18": "86] Writing for The New Yorker, Inkoo Kang gave a positive review, writing \"the airless sociological fatalism of Season 1, which was matched by a claustrophobic production due to covid-19 restrictions, gives way to a more mature drama, as well as a deeper exploration of how the characters' class concerns converge with gendered angst.\"[87] Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com wrote, \"Mike White is a writer that is as thrilled with a fascinating dinner conversation as he is a murder mystery, and so even as the plotting sags more than it did the first time, the way that his characters bounce off each other, unpacking their social constructs, remains fascinating.\"[88] Alison Herman of The Ringer praised the series' pivot to the theme of gender politics, writing \"White knows that sex, like money, is a form of power, and that each is intimately bound up in the other.\"[89] Melanie McFarland of Salon observed, \"You may not want to be in the same room with the people you're watching, but the sights alone provided a level of escapism like nothing else on TV.\"[90] For The Washington Post, Travis M. Andrews wrote \"though these new episodes meander at times, Season 2 is more tightly plotted and there are enough new ideas, with even the most staid insights heightened by White's razor-sharp writing, for it to feel fresh.",

Here's everything else you need to know, including its release date and a first look at the cast in action. This is going to be so good.  Yes! A first look trailer for the second season dropped at the beginning of October 2022, around three weeks before the series is due to land on NOW. HBO shared the trailer on Twitter alongside the caption, \"A vacation to die for.\" The trailer (watch it above) begins with Jennifer Coolidge aka Tanya saying, \"Whenever I stay at The White Lotus, I always have a memorable time. Always\", before giving us a glimpse at an Italian holiday filled with, er, cheating, drugs and potentially death. Classic The White Lotus, then. Ultimately, season two looks like it could standalone from season one, in that the characters are mostly different, the setting has changed and the storylines don't connect.

Though the season's ending wraps up fairly definitively, that does not preclude future installments of the hit series—and some beloved characters returning for another chapter. In fact, HBO already announced a second season for The White Lotus, though it will look fairly different from the past six episodes.  Mike White, the show's creator, recently won two Emmys for the show's first season—for best directing and best writing. With season two, White is set to deliver more dark humor, though he'll continue the series in an anthology format, with new characters and a new destination.

Rubio ran for president in 2016, winning the Minnesota primary before dropping out of the race eventually won by Trump, who mercilessly mocked Rubio as “Little Marco.” Rubio initially said he wouldn’t seek a second Senate term, which led to a scramble of GOP candidates looking to fill his seat.

Graham said that gaining control of both houses of Congress would be a very good night for the GOP but that “a wave would have been, like, New Hampshire and Colorado.” Hannah Hartig, NBC News Exit Poll Desk In North Carolina, broad economic pessimism and President Biden’s unpopularity helped buoy Republican Ted Budd to victory in the Senate race. Results from the NBC News Exit Poll show that most North Carolina voters rated national economic conditions as not good or poor. And a majority of voters said that, in the last year, inflation had caused their households at least moderate financial hardship.  Roughly one-third of North Carolina voters said inflation was the most important issue to their votes — and Budd was the clear favorite among those voters, 75% of whom voted for him, compared with 23% for Democrat Cheri Beasley.  There was also a sizable gender gap in vote preference in the Senate race, the exit poll found. While Beasley was the modest favorite among women, nearly 6 in 10 men cast their ballots for Budd.

I would make her coats and everything,” O’Neill explains. That work honed her ability to dress all ages. Several weeks ago, she lost her grandmother, who was 95. O’Neill is reflective about the way things have unfolded for her, and effusive about her appreciation of the first family’s sustained loyalty to her work. “[The Bidens] have always been very supportive and kind and thoughtful; so easy to work with, which I think is really rare with a lot of clients.

O’Neill predicts the wedding will supercharge her bridal business, just as the inauguration did for her ready-to-wear line. When the First Lady tapped her to design her look for the historic day, Markarian was a nearly four-year-old business that was popular among celebrities, but hardly one with a stronghold on the fashion world. “Few—or none, perhaps—would have predicted that Dr. Biden would walk out into the cold Washington morning on Wednesday in a matching blue coat and dress by Markarian, a small New York City brand whose typical aesthetic signatures include feather trims and full-body sequins,” the New York Times wrote at the time. Moda Operandi reported a 570 percent increase in traffic to Markarian on the site following the inauguration, and retailers saw sales grow by as much as 500 percent, O’Neill told Insider. Less than two years later, her colorful, embellished ensembles have become go-tos for the fashion set.

Ms. Biden, as the president often says, was named for his firstborn daughter, who died in a car crash along with Mr. Biden’s first wife, Neilia, in 1972. In April, Mr. Biden introduced himself as “Naomi Biden’s grandfather” at a White House event celebrating the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. In October, Ms. Biden stood beside her grandparents in a pink wig — her grandmother’s was purple — and handed out Halloween candy to trick-or-treaters.

A rehearsal dinner, hosted by the groom's parents, Drs.

Both President Biden and Dr. Biden were in attendance. The bride-to-be wore a custom-made outfit by bridal designer Danielle Frankel for the occasion, The New York Times reports. The \"transitional\" outfit was made from four separate pieces: a top bustier, a tailored jacket and trouser, and a pleated tulle cape covered in lace flowers.   \"This is a White House wedding, so there’s regard for the White House and for our country, but also for the sanctity of the wedding. We wanted to pay tribute to all of those components while still showcasing who Naomi is, respectful but sophisticated with a tinge of femininity,\" Frankel says. \"She’s young and cool.

President Joe Biden's eldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden - the daughter of Hunter Biden and his former wife Kathleen Buhle - is marrying fiancé Peter Neal at a ceremony on Saturday.  The White House is clearly a desired wedding location - and one not available to the average citizen.  Sarah Fling, with the White House Historical Association, explained to the BBC how often such events take place -  and who even gets to throw a White House wedding.  There are very few people who can sign off on hosting nuptials at the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States, said the historian. \"It's exciting because really there's no hard and fast rule about who can or cannot be married at the White House. It's essentially up to the President and First Lady.\" While most past weddings have been held for close family members of the president, some White House staff members have had the rare privilege.  \"In 1942, Harry Hopkins, who was a really close adviser to President Franklin Roosevelt, was able to have his wedding on the second floor of the White House in the Oval Room, which was at that time, President Roosevelt's private study,\" Ms Fling said.",

He slips his grandchildren $20 bills and makes it a rule to answer the phone whenever they call. Ms. Biden published a compilation of voice mail messages he left her during the presidential campaign — “Just called to tell you I love you,” he said in several. “They expand his mind and how he thinks about things in a way that I don’t think anybody else that I’ve seen does,” Jen Psaki, Mr. Biden’s former press secretary, said about the president’s relationship with his grandchildren. “They’re his connection, in some ways, to the outside world.” Wedding planning meetings were kept to a close group, including the first couple and Hunter Biden; Anthony Bernal, Dr. Biden’s senior adviser; and Elizabeth Alexander, her communications director. But it was the first couple whose names were listed on the wedding invitation.

Cox in the Rose Garden helped create an expectation that modern White House events should be open to the public. That wedding came complete with a six-tier wedding cake and some 700 credentialed journalists covering the event. The couple leaned into the idea that their wedding was a part of American history: Among their guests were several women who had married at the White House, including the 98-year-old Alice Roosevelt Longworth, who married there in 1906, and both daughters of former President Lyndon B. Johnson, Lynda and Luci Johnson. But Ms. Biden, who grew up staying with her grandparents at the vice president’s residence — where they installed bunk beds for their grandchildren — did not take this approach. Instead, she and Mr. Neal decided to plan the wedding “as a private celebration for their friends and family,” said a person familiar with their wishes.",

On the other hand, England retained important pieces of its veteran core that won the 1966 World Cup at Wembley, 5 and was imbued with a crop of new talent.6 Things didn’t work out so great for England — it was bounced 3-2 in the quarterfinal by West Germany after having been up 2-0 at halftime — but Pele and Brazil made history. It was the first Group of Death, and that’s because it was easily identifiable as a group that nobody (probably not even Brazil or England) wanted to be a part of given the pedigree that was on display.  We haven’t had such an obvious Group of Death since — and we certainly don’t this year.

It’s now a question of whether they can get over the line. Southgate will hope that Manchester United defender Harry Maguire can recapture his best form ahead of the tournament after his struggles at club level, while there will inevitably again be much scrutiny on Harry Kane, who will likely have the chance to become his country's leading all-time goalscorer. The U.S. will be joining the party at World Cup 2022, barely making it through regional qualifying on goal difference past Costa Rica. This will be the 11th time that the U.S. men's national team (USMNT) has featured on the global stage, with the best result coming via a semifinal run at the inaugural tournament in 1930.  Without question, Gregg Berhalter's side has enough young talent to have a chance at getting out of the group, and should excite supporters on the way, as they plot a potential deep World Cup run.",

Does it really affect a team’s chances of winning the World Cup? Or is it just an arbitrary (if amusing) rhetorical device pundits and fans like to use to drum up interest going into a big tournament like the World Cup?  Looking at Elo’s Groups of Death dating back to the 1970 World Cup, only two teams have won the world’s most prestigious soccer prize after grinding things out in the tournament’s toughest group — that legendary Brazil team in 1970, and a generationally great Spain team in 2010. That said, three others have reached the final out of the Group of Death and lost. So in the 13 World Cups since 1970, a total of five finalists have come from so-called Groups of Death — which is actually more than the number we’d expect (4.3) if every group had an equal chance of sending a team to the final.

The Japanese press out of the second half blocks stunned Spain, forcing a nervy clearance from Unai Simon. Doan pounced, thumping a left footed drive from outside the box. Within three minutes they led again, Doan attacking down the right and firing a cross to the back post. Mitoma flicked it across from the byline -- VAR would conclude the ball had just stayed in play -- and the ball bounced off Tanaka to fire Japan towards victory. For most of the second half this game was heading towards a scenario that would favor both sides at Germany's expense and yet there was little sense of Spain settling for defeat. Marco Asensio thumped a fizzing strike towards goal late on but Japan's defense was outstanding, only allowing the opposition in behind once as Gonda saved smartly from Olmo.

They’re both old men now, but they’re still two of the best players in the world — and two of the best players to ever kick a soccer ball, period. Does a battle between all-time greats chasing the game’s top prize for (probably) the last time qualify as Group of Death-worthy? We’re not sure!  What we’re trying to say is: Picking a Group of Death is hard — and not always straightforward.  To be fair to the 2022 World Cup, that’s historically been the case more often than not, too. Picking a Group of Death is more of an art form than a science. Sure, there were years when it was easier to pin down than others, as was the case before the 1970 World Cup. 2 At Mexico ‘70, Group 3 — they used numbers rather than letters back then — contained England (the reigning champs) and Brazil (perennial tournament favorites).",

In 2018, they survived a group containing Colombia, Poland and Senegal and then gave Belgium everything they could handle in the second round. Don't be shocked if they upset one of their decorated European foes. What success look like: Making it out of the first round at consecutive World Cups would be an unprecedented accomplishment for the Blue Samurai. Winning a knockout round match for the first time would be even better. Achilles heel: Scoring. The four forwards on Japan's 26-man roster have just 10 international goals between them. X-Factor: Defense. With a back line led by Arsenal center back Tomiyasu and captain Maya Yoshida, Japan is ultra-disciplined and organized defensively, making them extremely difficult for opponents to break down.

On the other hand, England retained important pieces of its veteran core that won the 1966 World Cup at Wembley, 5 and was imbued with a crop of new talent.6 Things didn’t work out so great for England — it was bounced 3-2 in the quarterfinal by West Germany after having been up 2-0 at halftime — but Pele and Brazil made history. It was the first Group of Death, and that’s because it was easily identifiable as a group that nobody (probably not even Brazil or England) wanted to be a part of given the pedigree that was on display.  We haven’t had such an obvious Group of Death since — and we certainly don’t this year. It’s hard to say whether we will in the future, either — especially if FIFA continues its apparent commitment to balanced groups going forward. And that’s probably fine — it’s too hard to define the Group of Death anyway. Jay Boice contributed research.

Take 1982, for example. There wasn’t a clear-cut Group of Death in the first group stage, but there was perhaps the Group of Death to end all Groups of Death in the second,3 featuring Italy, Brazil and the reigning champs, Argentina. Italy got through with a perfect record, and went on to spank West Germany in the final at the Bernabeu in Madrid. Again, though: There was hardly a clear Group of Death to start the tournament, and identifying them beforehand is sort of the whole point of Groups of Death. 4 We want to know these answers from the jump!

Remember that joint collective bargaining agreement signed by the US men's and women's national teams earlier this year? Now that the men have reached the knockout stage in Qatar, the women will earn more than they earned for winning the 2019 Women's World Cup. That's because now the US teams split their prize money evenly, and FIFA is offering $440 million in prize money for the 2022 men's World Cup, but only offered $30 million for the 2019 Women's World Cup.",

In their last four involvements at the World Cup, Saudi Arabia’s exit has come in the group stages — and it is difficult to envisage that being bettered this time around in Qatar.  Herve Renard’s team deserve credit for finishing above Australia in qualifying, but there is a feeling that they could find matters much more difficult when faced with tougher tasks. Each member of the Saudi Arabia squad currently plays in their home country, although in Renard they have a coach who has experienced the full breadth of international football, with previous spells in charge of Morocco, Ivory Coast, Zambia (twice) and Angola. At Russia 2018, Saudi Arabia exited having scored just two goals, and Renard will be desperately hoping that striker Saleh Al Shehri can return to full fitness to lead them this time after his four goals in the qualifiers.

Enzo Fernandez is another example alongside Mac Allister and Alvarez of players who can deliver when called upon, and if the Albicelestes are to win the whole thing, every one will need to chip in. And now we go to the heartbreak. Mexico's 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia was not enough to send them through. They pushed hard for a third goal to get them into second in the group, but ended up conceding in injury time, which sealed their fate. Goals from Henry Martin and Luis Chavez for Mexico gave El Tri a glimmer of hope in the second half, and as they pushed for a third, Saudi Arabia's Salem Al-Dawsari went through on goal to score from close range, eliminating both sides from the World Cup. With that, Mexico manager Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino's future with Mexico is over. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia will always have that massive upset against Messi and Argentina to remember. Not watching El Tri play in the knockouts will be a first for many of us. The last time Mexico failed to qualify for the knockouts was in 1978. Wonder who won the World Cup that year?

All eyes are sure to be on whether Belgium -- with talented players like Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard -- can get their attack together and stop the infighting where players are openly accusing one another of being too old and too slow at this World Cup. Everything is on the line for this one. Germany must beat Costa Rica to even have a chance to advance to the knockout round, but Germany will also need Spain to win the Group E's other game.

Poland had previously been given a bye straight through to the final match after first-round opponents Russia were banned by FIFA as a result of their country’s invasion of Ukraine.  Their 34-year-old Barcelona striker aside, Poland’s roster consists of plenty of experienced performers who play domestically across Europe.

On the other hand, England retained important pieces of its veteran core that won the 1966 World Cup at Wembley, 5 and was imbued with a crop of new talent.6 Things didn’t work out so great for England — it was bounced 3-2 in the quarterfinal by West Germany after having been up 2-0 at halftime — but Pele and Brazil made history. It was the first Group of Death, and that’s because it was easily identifiable as a group that nobody (probably not even Brazil or England) wanted to be a part of given the pedigree that was on display.  We haven’t had such an obvious Group of Death since — and we certainly don’t this year. It’s hard to say whether we will in the future, either — especially if FIFA continues its apparent commitment to balanced groups going forward.

For example, global extreme weather events can disrupt food supplies and supply chains, a wave of U.S. retirements have contributed to a smaller pool of available workers, and political tensions have led to more protectionism and self-sourcing — all of which have implications for inflation, Swonk said. \"I think we're in a world that's much more prone to inflation than the world we left,\" Swonk said. \"What is the new equilibrium once we've gotten there?\" she added. \"That's where the difficulty is.\" The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks are trying to make sense of these multi-pronged inputs and tamp down inflation by raising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. The dynamic serves to reduce demand, ultimately filtering through to prices. That's likely to be a lengthy process, according to some economists. \"Inflation has likely already peaked in most markets, but reducing price pressures tied to labor markets and wage growth will take longer,\" Vanguard Group economists wrote in an outlook report published Monday. \"As such, central banks may reasonably achieve their 2% inflation targets only in 2024 or 2025.\" Got a confidential news tip?

Each month coinciding with the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ release of the Consumer Price Index, JEC Republicans’ State Inflation Tracker estimates how much inflation increases costs for American families in each state and how the drivers of inflation continue to vary across the country. Specifically, we ask: how much more must the average household pay today to maintain the same standard of living it achieved in January 2021, the last time inflation was within historical norms? See our methodology for a full description of our methods and a downloadable data file with a detailed breakdown of inflation costs by state. You can find our full analysis for November 2022 here. See the highlights below: Prices increased 13.8 percent from January 2021 to October 2022, costing the average American household $747 last month alone. Even if prices stop increasing altogether, the inflation that has already occurred will cost the average American household $8,963 over the next 12 months. Families in the Mountain West (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) are facing the highest inflation rates, with prices today 16.5 percent higher than in January 2021.",

According to the numbers, Brazil will face their neighbours Argentina in the semi-finals. In Group C, Argentina have the highest chance of any side to progress from the group stages (90.2%) according to our model. It’ll be a relief for them, as the runners-up in that group likely face current champions France in the last 16. By topping their group, Argentina would then face Denmark, the predicted runners-up in Group D. In the quarter-finals, their battle would be against the Netherlands from Group A, who would have eliminated the USA in the first round of the knockouts.

Denmark showed in the Euro 2020 that they are not an average team. They made it to the semifinals and lost against England. They beat Wales 4-0 and Czech Republic 2-1 on their way to the semifinals. Recently, Denmark showed no mercy in the World Cup Qualifiers winning nine out of 10 matches. The likes of Damsgaard, Poulsen, Kjaer, and Delaney are making headlines. Argentina can find some difficulty beating Denmark in the Round Of 16. If Argentina manage to go through to the quarter-finals then they can face the Netherlands. This is on the assumption that the Netherlands are most likely to be the winner of their Group. Louis Van Gaal’s side are in form as well. Netherlands are on a 15-match unbeaten streak. Furthermore, they beat Senegal 2-0 in their World Cup opener. If the Netherlands manage to win their group then they can face the USA. This would be a match for the history books. Messi and Argentina would definitely look to take their revenge against Germany. Though not as prestigious as a final, Argentina would definitely find pleasure in knocking out Germany.

The last time Argentina came close to winning it was in 2014. Unfortunately, Messi’s side lost to Germany in the final. However this time the Argentinians are well prepared and are in form. They just won the Copa America last year and are unbeaten in 36 matches. Argentina are the favourites alongside Brazil to win the 2022 World Cup. Let’s assess the five potential knock-out stage opponents for Argentina in World Cup 2022. Provided that Argentina wins their group, they can face France in the Round Of 16. The last time this happened was in the 2018 World Cup but at Argentina’s demise. Deschamps France beat Argentina 4-3 in a thrilling match. However this time Argentina can surely manage to beat France. Not only is Argentina in great form but France itself is lacking several players. Karim Benzema, Nkunku, Kante and Pogba are set to miss the World Cup. The presence of Benzema and especially Kante would have been crucial to put down Argentina. Despite France missing out on some players, they can still manage to outdo Argentina because of their squad depth. Kylian Mbappe is definitely a player to watch out for as he showed up last time against Argentina.",

            "negative24": "In fact, their last defeat came at the hands of Brazil, a 2-0 loss in the 2019 Copa América semi-final. Brazil and Argentina first met in the World Cup in 1974, with Brazil winning 2-1. After their first encounter, they met again in the following two tournaments at the group-stage level: drawing 0-0 in 1978 and Brazil winning 3-1 in 1982. Argentina’s only victory against the Seleção came in their only knockout clash: a 1-0 win in the round of 16 in 1990. In some ways, this match should be the final. According to our model, these are the two strongest World Cup squads in the tournament and are ranked first and second in terms of their chances of winning the whole thing. It would promise to be an epic encounter. But win that, and the final of the 2022 World Cup would be a replay of 1998. That means… On 18 December 2022 in Lusail, the Seleção will walk out against the current holders France. After a painful defeat in 1998 that gave France their first World Cup title, Brazil would have the chance to avenge their former manager Mário Zagallo. Les Bleus will likely have to face Mexico in the last 16, before two all-European contests in the next two rounds.",
            "negative25": "The 2014 World Cup winners have many young players in their squad. Hansi Flick’s arrival is definitely an upgrade but the players are taking time to adapt to his style of play. Nonetheless, it will be an interesting match because Germany have players like Sane, Gnabry, Muller and even Gotze with them. Besides Argentina, Brazil are the most favoured candidates to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup. It would not be surprising to see Brazil defeat Argentina as well. Brazil lost to Argentina in the Copa America final and ever since then, they are unbeaten in 15 matches. Brazil have failed to make it past three Quarter-Finals over the past four World Cups. Neymar, Brazil’s star player is key for all of their fixtures. The PSG superstar is in great form and is arguably the most essential player for Brazil in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. If Argentina do face Brazil in the Semi-finals, surely Neymar and Messi will play a prominent role to win the match for their home nation. This will surely be one of the best matches in the 2022 FIFA World Cup if it happens. For more updates, follow Khel Now on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and join our community on Telegram.",
            "negative26": "Les Bleus are among the favourites to lift the trophy in Qatar, but who do they have to beat? France are the defending champions at the 2022 World Cup and emerged from their group to take their place in the knockout stage of the competition in Qatar. Didier Deschamps' side defeated Australia and Denmark on their way to the last 16, but tougher challenges now lie ahead, with no room for error on the road to the final. So, what will France need to do to retain their crown and win the World Cup for the third time in their history? GOAL takes a look at Les Bleus' route to the final. France topped Group D with six points, finishing ahead of Australia, Tunisia and Denmark. The reigning champions won their opening match 4-1 against Australia, before defeating Denmark 2-1. They lost their final group game 1-0 to Tunisia, but advanced as the top team nonetheless. Poland were France's opponents in the last 16 of the 2022 World Cup. Robert Lewandowski and Co. finished second to Argentina in Group C. The game was played on Sunday December 4, 2022, and France ran out 3-1 winners. France's reward for beating Poland is a quarter-final showdown against England. That particular quarter-final fixture is scheduled for December 10, 2022 with a 7pm GMT (2pm ET) kick-off.",
            "negative27": "By rajarshi shukla France are very much the heavy favourite to win the 2022 World Cup after defeating Australia 4-1 in their first match. Although injuries have plagued France, but the defending champions demonstrated their grit and mindset despite the absence of many key players. There are hardly many opponents France could face in the knockout stages and be the second favourite. They have a 90% chance of finishing first in their group and will meet the runners-up from group B. The 2018 World Cup champions are seeded in Group D, alongside Tunisia, Switzerland, and Denmark. The following article discusses their potential candidates in the knockout stages. France have a 70% probability of reaching the quarter-finals, and their head-to-head record puts them far ahead of Poland. Out of 16 matches, the incumbent champions have won eight, Poland three, and the rest have ended in draws. They have only met once in the World Cup, in a 3-2 thrilling victory for Poland in a 1982 play-off encounter. France’s team are currently unravaged, and Poland is unlikely to come to terms with this degree of proficiency; hence France should easily win. Although the quarter-finals are still up in the air, as they might meet either the Netherlands or Argentina, however, if they meet the Netherlands, their chances are slim. Their head-to-head record favours France, with 14 victories from 28 games and 11 losses.",
            "negative28": "All these reasons make Spain one of the most difficult opponents France could face in the knockout stages. The all-time FIFA World Cup match might be between Brazil and France, and whoever advances to the final should win the World Cup. Brazil have only won once in four World Cup meetings with France, although the head-to-head record is even, with each team winning six games out of fifteen. Yet, when comparing their squads, Brazil are far superior, but their defence is ponderous, and France will take advantage of any opportunity to expose them. Danilo and Sandro are not top-level full-backs and will struggle to contain Mbappe and Dembele. However, Brazil will undoubtedly ensure that this encounter goes to the wire, and it remains to be seen which group has the more individual quality to reach the final. France have a better midfield defence and forwards than Brazil, as many A Selecao players are not at the elite level. If France can break through the lines, they will reach another World Cup final.

France is heading back to the World Cup semifinals in back-to-back tournaments after a thrilling and nerve-wracking 2-1 quarterfinal victory over England.  It was a battle of the titans. Both teams made the semifinals of the last World Cup in Russia four years ago. France is the defending champion and had sparkled in Qatar behind a bevy of stars including Kylian Mbappé who leads the tournament with five goals (he was mostly silenced in this contest). It was France which scored first. In the 17th minute, Antoine Griezmann (playing in his 72nd straight game) passed to Aurélien Tchouaméni who delivered a blistering strike from far outside the box to silence England 1-0.",

A team overflowing with talent, France have reached the knockout stages of the past eight major tournaments (Euros, World Cups and Olympic Games) it has qualified for, all while domestic powerhouse Lyon have conquered Europe time and again, winning the Champions League a record eight times. Although Lyon are augmented with players from around the world, the club has long been a home to the majority of France's best and brightest footballers. - Euro 2022: News and features | Schedule | Squads | LIVE on ESPN - Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only) - Don't have ESPN? Get instant access With all the quality in the side, the question lingers: when will France finally make good on their promise and win a major international trophy? Each new tournament brings about a new hope that is swiftly replaced with aching disappointment as Les Bleues bow out early and empty-handed. With talent not an issue -- particularly not since the arrival of striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto -- other concerns come to the fore.",
            "negative31": "Their quarter-final opponent could be England (projected to knockout Senegal) and the semi-final would be a titanic clash against four-time winners Germany. France are Brazil’s kryptonite in the World Cup. After being eliminated by the Brazilians in the 1958 semi-final, they’ve got their revenge on three separate occasions. Besides winning the 1998 title against Brazil in the final, Les Bleus knocked the Seleção out of the World Cup in 1986 and in 2006, both times in the quarter-finals. Only four teams have defeated Brazil more than once in World Cup history, and France are one of them, alongside Hungary (x2), Italy (x2) and Netherlands (x3). But, as detailed in the graphic above, the supercomputer thinks 2022 is Brazil’s time. According to our model, France have an 11.9% chance of winning their second title in a row. It’s the third-highest percentage of any team, but Brazil rank higher. The Seleção are favourites to win in Qatar, with the model giving them a 16.2% chance of lifting the trophy. Brazil won the first World Cup played in Asia and according to our model, they will win the second. Twenty years after Ronaldo scored twice against Germany in Japan, who will be the Brazilian hero at the World Cup 2022 in Qatar?",
            "negative32": "Both teams have good squads, but France are much more technical, while the Netherlands appears to toil in matches. Thus we believe France will advance to the quarter-finals. This will be a legitimate showdown, and it will be a close one. Argentina lost their first World Cup encounter, casting doubt on the squad’s ability to face any of the competition’s major opponents. Argentina leads the series with six wins to France’s three in 12 games. And they’ve met France three times in World Cups, with Argentina winning twice in 1930 and 1978. This will be a competitive game, and if France can attack Argentina’s leaky defence while remaining strong at the back, they have a 60% chance of reaching the semi-finals. Things will get more complicated from here, as France might meet Spain in the semi-finals, and both nations have massive rosters and individual quality on the field. Spain leads France in head-to-head encounters, with 16 victories to France’s 13 in 36. Although they only met once at the World Cup, France defeated Spain 3-1 in the round of 16. Spain are undoubtedly known for their possession-based football, and France will need to be cautious and pounce on their faults since Spain lacks pacy players aside from Jordi Alba and Balde, which we can see Mbappe and Dembele exploiting from the flanks.",
            "negative33": "If, that is, the attack showcases the best of PSG, the defence is built on the Lyon centre-back pairing of Renard and Griedge Mbock anchoring the team (and likely to chip in with a goal or two), and exceptional young full-back Selma Bacha deployed on the left. The team comes into the tournament on a 13-match winning run and has been beaten only once in its past 28 outings: a 2-0 loss to the USWNT. But as the history books have taught us, that counts for naught. Yet, the culture around the team remains a sizable question mark, not least with former Lyon coach Reynald Pedros who said: \"Players returned to their clubs very psychologically affected. They go to the France team out of obligation, not out of pleasure. They go to the French team with a pit in their stomach.\" With the France team appearing jovial in 2019 only for some of those players to be frozen out, it's hard to get a clear read on them now and not cynically question what is said by players who are in the fold. But what we do know is that the PSG front three do enjoy playing together -- there is a clear camaraderie there, just as we know Renard and Mbock's club partnership has been benefiting France for years.",
            "negative34": "Long-simmering infighting, political power struggles and off-the-pitch drama present problems that could again threaten France's bid at the Euros -- starting July 10 in a group with Italy, Iceland and Belgium. Possessing one of the finest attackers in the world in Katoto, this might be the best France team ever seen, but a win is far from certain -- and anything other than three points could send the team into a spiral. At the 2011 Women's World Cup, an unfancied France shocked and delighted in equal measure as they danced across pitches in Germany. The team, the first crop of women who had graced the halls of Clairefontaine as teens, brought back forgotten memories of the victorious French men's team from 1998, and with little surprise as that generation of talent had been so visible and inspiring for those women wearing familiar dark blue shirts. There were instant comparisons too: Marseille-born Louisa Necib with her silky first touch could have been Zinedine Zidane's long-lost sister, while defensive rock Laura Georges appeared to be cast in the same mould as Lilian Thuram. In a time when French men's football was under a dark cloud, the women brought joy to those who watched them, and fast began to promise a new era in foot francais.",
            "negative35": "Brazil defeated Spain 1-0 in the first round of the group stage, but both teams progressed to the round of 16, and both were eliminated in a penalty shootout in the quarter-finals that year. After performing below expectations in the last two World Cups, Spain will be keen to eliminate Brazil, but we’re mapping the route of the five-time world champions here, and Tite’s men will progress to the semi-final stage, where they’ll face… The supercomputer projects another South American rival will stand in the way of Brazil’s route to glory. According to the numbers, Brazil will face their neighbours Argentina in the semi-finals. In Group C, Argentina have the highest chance of any side to progress from the group stages (90.2%) according to our model. It’ll be a relief for them, as the runners-up in that group likely face current champions France in the last 16. By topping their group, Argentina would then face Denmark, the predicted runners-up in Group D. In the quarter-finals, their battle would be against the Netherlands from Group A, who would have eliminated the USA in the first round of the knockouts. USA are projected to finish second in Group B, ahead of Wales and Iran. Argentina arrive at the World Cup on the back of a 35-game unbeaten run (W24 D11), the longest in their history.",
            "negative36": "The pre-match build up was dominated by the omission of Brazilian striker Ronaldo from the starting lineup only to be reinstated 45 minutes before kick-off.[12] He managed to create the first open chance for Brazil in the 22nd minute, dribbling past defender Thuram before sending a cross out on the left side that goalkeeper Fabien Barthez struggled to hold onto. France however took the lead in the 27th minute after Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos conceded a corner which Zidane scored with a header from the right.[13] Three minutes before half-time, Zidane scored his second goal of the match, similarly another header from a corner, this time from the left side. The tournament hosts went down to ten men in the 68th minute as Marcel Desailly was sent off for a second bookable offence. Brazil reacted to this by making an attacking substitution and although they applied pressure France sealed the win with a third goal: substitute Patrick Vieira set up his club teammate Petit in a counterattack to shoot low past goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel.[14]  French president Jacques Chirac was in attendance to congratulate and commiserate the winners and runners-up respectively after the match.[15] Several days after the victory, winning manager Aimé Jacquet announced his resignation from the French team with immediate effect.[16][17][18]  Man of the Match: Zinedine Zidane (France)  Assistant referees: Mark Warren (England)",
            "negative37": "In fact, their last defeat came at the hands of Brazil, a 2-0 loss in the 2019 Copa América semi-final. Brazil and Argentina first met in the World Cup in 1974, with Brazil winning 2-1. After their first encounter, they met again in the following two tournaments at the group-stage level: drawing 0-0 in 1978 and Brazil winning 3-1 in 1982. Argentina’s only victory against the Seleção came in their only knockout clash: a 1-0 win in the round of 16 in 1990. In some ways, this match should be the final. According to our model, these are the two strongest World Cup squads in the tournament and are ranked first and second in terms of their chances of winning the whole thing. It would promise to be an epic encounter. But win that, and the final of the 2022 World Cup would be a replay of 1998. That means… On 18 December 2022 in Lusail, the Seleção will walk out against the current holders France. After a painful defeat in 1998 that gave France their first World Cup title, Brazil would have the chance to avenge their former manager Mário Zagallo. Les Bleus will likely have to face Mexico in the last 16, before two all-European contests in the next two rounds.",
            "negative38": "England will be aiming to lift the World Cup for the first time since 1966 Gareth Southgate is aiming to become the first ever England manager to reach two consecutive World Cup semi-finals. England secured their place in the World Cup quarter-final after a resounding 3-0 victory over Senegal in the last 16. The game saw England talisman Harry Kane get his first goal of the tournament while Bukayo Saka and Jordan Henderson also got their name on the scoresheet. Advertisement Advertisement The Three Lions have been the highest scoring team at the World Cup so far with an impressive 12 goals across their opening four games - equalling the all time record previously set by Southgate’s men four years ago. Many England supporters are dreaming of going all the way in Qatar and young lions such as Jude Bellingham, Declan Rice and Phil Foden are amongst the players to receive critical acclaim by football experts. Attention will now turn to a mouth-watering clash against reigning world champions France. Didier Deschamps side will provide tough opposition for the Three Lions and they are blessed with a host of elite players including the tournament’s top scorer Kylian Mbappe, France’s all time leading goalscorer Oliver Giroud and pacey Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele. England will need to be at their best to beat a star-studded French team and will be hoping to get another step closer to ending their 56 year wait for a major trophy.",
            "negative39": "Hence, it's why Katoto's omission from Corinne Diacre's squad for the 2019 World Cup raised so many eyebrows -- even at 20 years old, the centre-forward was one of the most menacing in Division 1 Feminine. As it was, with even more expectation on Les Bleues as hosts who had watched their male counterparts lift the trophy in Russia the previous summer, the team came undone as it routinely had every other summer for eight years. Arguably peaking in their first game of the 2019 World Cup against a dismal South Korea side, Diacre's team had at least managed to capture the public's imagination in that opening match, but the side could not fulfil the promises it had silently made at the Parc des Princes. A return to Paris three weeks later brought about the abrupt end to France's challenge as they bowed out to the United States, a lack of goals plaguing the team. \"I'm vigorous -- that's typical of me. Often, I'm told I'm very strict. We never laugh around, we never joke; everything is very calculated, there's no exceptions. The girls are very unhappy and you can see that on the field.\" Diacre's words were dripping with sarcastic ennui as she faced the media ahead of France's round-of-16 clash with Brazil at the 2019 World Cup.",
            "negative40": "Diacre has argued that 32-year-old Charlotte Bilbault could offer things in the middle of the pitch that Henry could not, yet for those who have seen the depth of Henry's game or watched as she has returned to form this season -- including leading Lyon to a Champions League trophy in May -- this reads as a half-baked excuse. Repeatedly those in the game have called on Noel Le Graet, the president of the French Football Federation, to relieve Diacre of her position, but Le Graet has remained faithful to the coach. Last year, he acknowledged some disagreements between former players and the coach, but assured: \"Faith in Corinne is starting to pay off.\" The PSG front three of Sandy Baltimore, Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani is likely to feature heavily at the Euros, with Baltimore and Diani interchanged with Lyon duo Delphine Cascarino and Melvine Malard, each attacker offering up something a little different. The thought now is very much that this France team will finally be the one that doesn't struggle for goals, the caveat that its hauls in qualifiers and friendlies are still just a pre-tournament footnote and not an indication of the summer to come.",
            "negative41": "The players may have come and gone as the reins have been passed from one to coach to the next, but the pedigree around Les Bleues has certainly not diminished since their breakthrough in 2011. The question of, \"if not now, then when?\" is one that has followed the nation for over a decade. But whether the strength of the club partnerships will be enough for France to finally vault over their biggest hurdles and win the Euros, or at least, show up with the steely determination that's been lacking, remains to be seen.",
            "negative42": "Yet, when push came to shove at the 2011 World Cup, the 2013 Euros and all the subsequent majors that followed, the goals always seemed to desert the Les Bleues at the vital moments. Up to now, France have rarely stumbled during qualification, but there has seldom been a confidence or winning mentality within the talented team. As stars like Necib, Camille Abily and Sonia Bompastor have come and gone, retiring with no national team honours, the team have still remained a perpetual favourite for pundits and fans alike ahead of summer tournaments. With the team routinely relying on goals not just from the midfield but from defender Wendie Renard -- and Georges before she retired -- the emergence of Katoto has solidified the tag ahead of this summer's Euros, giving rise to hopes that France may finally be in position to win a trophy. An unrivalled goal-getter, Katoto possesses a one-track mind in the box, and her determination separates her from those who've worn the No. 9 for France over the years. The Parisian is the type of striker that former managers Bruno Bini or Philippe Bergeroo would have given their left arms for at the 2011 or 2015 World Cups.",

In June 2022, Robbie and Gosling were pictured in LA on the set of the film (see the photos here), marking the latter's first time being spotted while filming in character.",

Additionally, Emerald Fennell is playing Midge while Michael Cera is playing Allan.   Character posters were also unveiled for non-Barbie characters, including America Ferrera as \"a human,\" Ariana Greenblatt as another \"human,\" Helen Mirren as \"the narrator,\" Connor Swindells as an \"intern,\" and Jamie Demetriou as \"a suit.\"   \"People don't have any idea what to expect [with the film], and I think that that's the right vibe,\" Ferrera told PEOPLE in October 2022 about the film's plot. \"Whatever you think it is, it's not that. It's something else.\"   During the 20th Unforgettable Gala, Liu teased that the film is all about \"inner beauty,\" and that Gerwig paid special attention to diversity and inclusivity when it came to casting for the film.   \"I remember very clearly about some of our big intricate dance sequences. Greta was very, very conscientious about who she cast,\" he said, according to Vanity Fair.",
            "negative10": "Back in June 2021 interview, Robbie spoke about the pressures of playing such an iconic character. 'Right, it comes with a lot of baggage!' she told British Vogue. 'And a lot of nostalgic connections. But with that come a lot of exciting ways to attack it. People generally hear \"Barbie\" and think, \"I know what that movie is going to be,\" and then they hear that Greta Gerwig is writing and directing it, and they’re like, \"Oh, well, maybe I don’t...\"'     Barbie will hit cinemas on July 21, 2023. The Warner Bros. project was first announced in 2019, but is now being released four years later. Variety has confirmed that Gerwig and Baumbach were planning to finish the film after Baumbach finished on his 2022 film White Noise.  While they might share similar physical attributes - long blonde hair, blue eyes, a wide smile - Robbie and Barbie also share somewhat similar career trajectories.  After all, Barbie has been known to have more than 150 careers on her CV, from registered nurse to rock star, veterinarian to aerobics instructor, pilot to police officer.  According to the Barbie website, the doll first broke the 'plastic ceiling' in the 1960s when, 'as an astronaut, she went to the moon…four years before Neil Armstrong'.",

In April, Warner Bros. debuted a handful of character posters, which gave more insight into who everyone from the cast was playing. The studio also released the official poster for the film, which features Robbie and Gosling on the iconic Barbie logo.   The first teaser trailer for the Barbie movie dropped on Dec. 16, 2022. The 74-second clip opens with little girls playing with baby dolls in a rugged setting.   \"Since the beginning of time, since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls,\" the narrator can be heard saying. \"But the dolls were always and forever baby dolls. Until ...\"   The camera then cuts to Robbie towering over the girls in a black-and-white striped bathing suit, black heels and white sunglasses. In awe of Barbie, the girls decide to smash their baby dolls.   Viewers then get a brief look at the playful and colorful world of Barbie.   On Dec. 17, 2022, Liu spoke to PEOPLE about the clip and his experience making the film.",

When I found out I got the part I called her singing the Aqua 'Barbie' song.\" As for reuniting with Mackey, Gatwa felt it to be a blessing. \"We had just had such an intense five years together where we all became so close. We love each other so much and it's incredibly exciting seeing everyone go off and do their own things, but to be able to come back together? That's a magical experience.\" Ana Cruz Kayne has an impressive list of credits to her name, including the inventive sci-fi film Another Earth (2011), the CBS crime drama series Bull, Louis C.K.'s sitcom Louie, the Tom Selleck drama Blue Bloods, and the upcoming Netflix series Painkiller. She also appeared in Gerwig's brilliant adaptation of Little Women (2019). Kayne took particular pleasure in bringing visibility to the Barbie universe.",

Though it's safe to assume the movie probably won't be a straightforward, fluffy film á la Barbie Life in The Dreamhouse. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Robbie confirmed as much. \"People immediately have an idea of, 'Oh, Margot is playing Barbie, I know what that is,'\" she said, \"But our goal is to be like, 'Whatever you’re thinking, we’re going to give you something totally different—the thing you didn’t know you wanted.'\"  The rumors of the film harboring multiple Barbies have been confirmed by Sex Education and Death on The Nile alum, Mackey. Speaking to Empire, Mackey mentioned a sleepover amongst the Barbie cast that has fans talking. “Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies, which would involve playing games with Scott [Evans] and Ncuti [Gatwa],” she said.  She later added, \"Barbie is light and funny and silly and American and pink.\" Rest assured, it won't make you cry. \"It’s very unexpected in many ways,\" Mackey said. I think people are going to have an idea of the film, and I don’t think it’s going to be that. It’s going to be a surprise. And it’s a comedy, thank God. No crying in this film! Let me tell you that.

She dropped out in 2017 and later said: “They definitely didn’t want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it.” It was then set to star Anne Hathaway before it finally went to Robbie, who asked Gerwig to get involved. The film is set to be followed by another Mattel adaptation, a take on Polly Pocket written and directed by Lena Dunham and starring Lily Collins. Dunham confirmed in October she is still working on the script. Other Mattel films in development include Masters of the Universe and Hot Wheels. Gerwig made her directorial debut with Lady Bird, which earned five Oscar nominations before she brought a new adaptation of Little Women in 2019, which garnered six Oscar nods. Robbie’s latest film, Babylon, co-starring Brad Pitt, hits cinemas this month and she will be next seen in Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City alongside Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton.

When Mulligan asked if the film would have any Barbie houses, Robbie responded, \"The Dreamhouses? You'll see some Dreamhouses. And it will be everything you ever dreamed of.\"   On April 25, 2023, a preview of the film was shown at CinemaCon 2023 in Las Vegas. During the event, Gerwig spoke about her joyful experience filming the movie and said she \"cried when I stepped on the set for the first time.\"   Robbie, who also helped present the preview at CinemaCon, told Gerwig, \"You were just so happy; we felt that every day.\"   While there are currently no plans for a Barbie sequel, Robbie has hinted that another movie is possible. In June 2023, the actress said that the story \"could go a million different directions from this point.\"   The following month, Gergig talked about the possibility of a sequel — or sequels — when she told PEOPLE she hopes her film \"is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies,\" adding, \"I want to go back to Barbie Land.\"   From the cast to the soundtrack, here's everything to know about the Barbie movie.",

We don’t know too much about the movie, but we do know that Greta Gerwig has signed on as its director. Gerwig also co-wrote the movie’s script with Noah Baumbach. We guess Gosling makes for a fine choice to play Ken. Honestly, we don’t know too much about Ken as a person. Other than he, too, holds a lot of jobs, has a great head of hair, and loves the beach. As for what to expect from Liu, Ferrera, and Shipp’s roles, I’d be shocked if Liu wasn’t playing Ken’s fellow surfer bro. Or at least some sort of pal. The energy is just there. We have to remind you though that the top-notch Barbie movie already exists. And it stars Tyra Banks and Lindsay Lohan.",

Shipp is perhaps best known for her role as Ororo Munroe/Storm in the \"X-Men\" universe. She's also had roles in the hit movie \"Straight Outta Compton\" and \"Shaft.\"  Sharon Rooney plays Lawyer Barbie, a doll who is — you guessed it — a lawyer and part of Stereotypical Barbie's friend group. Rooney gained fame in the UK starring in the series \"My Mad Fat Diary.\" Since then, the Scottish actor has starred in numerous comedies and dramas. She also appeared in the 2019 reboot of \"Dumbo\" as a circus resident called Miss Atlantis. Michael Cera plays Allan in \"Barbie.\" He's the only male doll not named Ken in Barbie Land. Allan is a discontinued doll who is friends with Ken and Barbie. He was married to Midge and had children with her.

But suddenly, it’s like, ‘No, we’ve cared about Ken this whole time.’ No, you didn’t. You never did. You never cared. Barbie never fucked with Ken. That’s the point. If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed.

The pregnant doll was reportedly pulled from Wal-Mart shelves in 2002 after conservatives complained that it promoted teenage pregnancy.  Fennell played a young Queen Camilla in seasons three and four of Netflix's \"The Crown.\" She also wrote and directed the film \"Promising Young Woman,\" and was the showrunner for season two of \"Killing Eve.\" Will Ferrell appears to be playing the movie's main antagonist, the CEO of Mattel. Ferrell told People that his character is \"insensitive.\" This is not the first time Ferrell has played a CEO in a movie based on a toy brand.

Prior to his Marvel role, he starred as Jung in the hit Canadian comedy \"Kim's Convenience.\" Emma Mackey plays a Barbie who's won a Nobel Prize in physics. She is also part of the main Barbie friend group. Robbie told BuzzFeed that she and Gerwig cast Mackey because they thought it would be funny to make a joke about how the two actresses look alike. But when they both got in costume, they realized they didn't actually look very similar. Outside of being Robbie's lookalike, Mackey is best known for playing Maeve in the hit Netflix teen show \"Sex Education,\" which returns for its final season later this year.

On the train, phones protrude from other rows at unnatural angles, and the ticket taker in our car keeps coming by to offer him snacks. In Barbie—a massively ambitious summer blockbuster that attempts to both honor the generations of children who played with the doll while also introducing new and sophisticated gender politics, the concept of mortality, and an ironic opening homage to Kubrick’s 2001—Gosling plays Ken, the adoring doll that orbits Barbie, who is played by Robbie.

One of them is named Darrell. And Darrell works at a grocery store,” Gosling said.  As for Barbie, Amada and Esmeralda decided to name her “Gym Class.” “And Gym Class met Darrell at the grocery store, but Gym Class, she’s focusing on herself right now,” the proud dad explained.  It sounds like he’s “just Ken,” to them.  Gosling joked, “He’s such a nonpresence in their world. They were like ‘What is there to play? Is there meat on that bone?’” Despite his daughters’ lack of enthusiasm, the “Crazy, Stupid, Love” actor said he easily connected to his character.  “It came naturally,” he told the publication. “I grew up in a house run by women.

DreamWorks had advertised heavily during the holiday 2001 season for Shrek, but was disappointed when the rumored Best Picture nomination did not materialize, though it was nominated for and ultimately won the inaugural Best Animated Feature award.[1]  The criticism surrounding the Best Animated Feature category was particularly prominent at the 81st Academy Awards, in which WALL-E won the award but was not nominated for Best Picture, despite receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike and being generally considered to be one of the best films of 2008.[19][20][21][22] This sparked controversy over whether the film was deliberately snubbed of such nomination by the Academy.

There is also a timeliness to this adaptation. Pinocchio – an innocent who is forced to see the harsh realities of war, death and societal collapse, yet retains a sense of optimism – is prescient amid intensifying global conflict and offers hope. Del Toro is no stranger to awards success. In 2007, his breakout hit Pan’s Labyrinth won the Hugo award for best dramatic presentation. He also won the best director and best picture Oscars for The Shape of Water in 2017. In some ways, Pinocchio’s win was predictable. The film has, without doubt, received more press coverage than its rivals through a powerfully sustained campaign. Pinocchio’s fellow nominees – Puss in Boots, The Sea Beast and Turning Red –  are typical of the state and quality of animation in 2023. They’re colourful, entertaining and wonderfully animated, but rather standard CGI creations, with none of the more complex tones of del Toro’s Pinocchio.

I'm very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation.\"[29] Some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision to not broadcast the award.[30]  Another factor is that numerous animated films have been made for mature audiences or with ranges of PG-13 or more, with a few of them —The Triplets of Belleville, Persepolis, Chico and Rita, The Wind Rises, Anomalisa, My Life as a Courgette, The Breadwinner, Loving Vincent, Isle of Dogs, I Lost My Body and Flee— having been nominated in this category, though none have won.[31][32]",

York St John University provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners In winning the 2023 Academy Award for best animated feature, director Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio continues its remarkable run of accolades, from the Golden Globes to the Baftas. Del Toro has used the platform afforded by his nominations to champion the medium of animation as true cinema, proclaiming in his Bafta award speech:  Animation is not a genre for kids. It’s a medium for art, it’s a medium for film and I think animation should stay in the conversation. His rendition of Pinocchio has certainly started a conversation, not least in gaining an impressive audience on Netflix. His film demonstrates that in the right creative environment – and with an innovator at the helm – a well-worn narrative, such as Pinocchio, can evolve. Such revitalisation of the Pinocchio story was in part possible because – as he says himself – del Toro didn’t craft his retelling solely with children in mind.",
            "negative21": "Scott added: \"I see some parents who know exactly what we're talking about.\"[24] The remarks were heavily criticized by animation fans and those working in the animation industry as infantilizing the medium and perpetuating the stigma that animated works are strictly for children, especially since the industry was credited with sustaining the flow of Hollywood content and revenue during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phil Lord, co-producer of one of the nominated films, The Mitchells vs. the Machines, tweeted that it was \"super cool to position animation as something that kids watch and adults have to endure.\" The film's official social media accounts responded to the joke with an image reading: \"Animation is cinema.\"[25][26] A week later, Lord and his producing partner Christopher Miller wrote a guest column in Variety criticizing the Academy for the joke and how Hollywood has been treating animation writing that \"no one set out to diminish animated films, but it's high time we set out to elevate them.\" They also suggested to the Academy that the category should be presented by a filmmaker who respects the art of animation as cinema.[27]  Adding to the controversy was that the award for Best Animated Short Film (the nominees for which were mostly made up of shorts not aimed at children) was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast.",
            "negative22": "Del Toro’s next project will be The Buried Giant, an animated adaptation of the 2015 Kazio Ishiguro novel. It’s set in an alternative post-Arthurian Britain in which people are incapable of retaining long-term memories. An elderly couple set out on a quest to find a long-lost son that they fleetingly recall. In his Oscars acceptance speech, del Toro said: “Animation is ready to be taken to the next step … We are all ready for it.” In a backstage interview, he stated that his film is:  About disobedience – and disobedience is urgent in the world now. How we can love each other in our failings, in our flaws, in our humanity.  Guillermo del Toro’s Pinnochio is a pioneering film in the ongoing efforts to reframe the medium of animation. But it’s also symbolic of del Toro’s wider work to date – the perfect example of his passion for stories which illuminate our humanity, even in the face of dehumanising oppression.

            "negative24": "When I interviewed Guillermo del Toro in 2015, he was transparent in his intention to shift between cinematic modes, stating that “animation is in many ways the future”. He believed that animated films should be universally held in the high esteem they receive in parts of Europe and Japan, “where they understand that animation is a medium, not a genre.” Del Toro struck me then, and continues to do so, as an artist with an incredible determination to fulfil his vision across a body of work. As he told me: “I think [animation] is my desirable future – the only thing I want to make sure is that I find randomness.”  I interpret “randomness” here as the ability to recapture the charm of the perceived imperfections of stop motion animation, brought about by advances in digital animation. This combines with the sophistication of evolving stop motion practice, which now allows for nimble implementations of decisions made on set. This ability to achieve “randomness” is evident in Pinocchio and may be attributed to a blend of abundant resources and technical and creative innovation. Thanks to the deep pockets of Netflix, Pinocchio’s production was vast, involving 40 animators (and nearly 1,000 days of shooting, including, at times 60 sets, 60 cameras and 60 stages), working on complex scenes, some of which took years to perfect.",

The game involves the winning team from the American Football Conference championship game facing the winning team from the National Football Conference championship game. Since 1967 when the merger agreement took place between the NFC and AFC, teams have been competing to receive the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the great coach of the Green Bay Packers. It was this team that won the first two Super Bowls, raising questions over whether the AFC was good enough to compete in the event. Originally the NFL and AFL, the two leagues combined into one league in 1970 and instead split into two conferences, with 3 NFL teams converting over to the AFC to equal 13 teams on each side. The term Super Bowl was created by Kansas City Chief Owner Lamar Hunt after seeing his daughter play with a toy called the Super Ball. Only supposed to be a nickname until an official name was released, the term Super Bowl has stuck with the game ever since.

He wound up winning everything a player can win in a single season -- including league MVP and Super Bowl MVP -- and he delivered this latest championship while playing with a high ankle sprain against the league's best pass rush.

Microsoft is introducing a new consumer tier to its Microsoft 365 subscription offerings. Priced at just $1.99 per month, Microsoft 365 Basic is designed to replace the 100GB OneDrive storage option with some extra features that sit in between the free option and the $6.99 a month Personal subscription. Microsoft 365 Basic will be available worldwide on January 30th with 100GB of cloud storage, an ad-free Outlook web and mobile experience, and enhanced security features. The security features include data encryption for an Outlook mailbox, suspicious link checking, and virus / malware scanning for attachments. Existing OneDrive 100GB storage customers will be automatically upgraded to Microsoft 365 Basic at the same $1.99 monthly rate. “Later this year, we’ll have a bunch of stuff with OneDrive advanced security that will be available as well, that includes Personal Vault, password-protected and expiring links, ransomware detection and recovery, and bulk file restore,” says Gareth Oystryk, director of product marketing for Microsoft 365, in an interview with The Verge. Microsoft 365 Basic will also include access to Microsoft technical support, which includes help over the phone or via online chat for both Microsoft 365 apps and Windows 11.",

Today, we’re introducing Microsoft 365 Basic, the newest way to get started with Microsoft 365. With Microsoft 365 Basic, we’re making premium subscription benefits available to even more people at a great price. Initially, Microsoft 365 Basic will include essential peace of mind benefits like 100 gigabytes (GB) of cloud storage, ad-free and secure email with Outlook, and access to support experts for help with Microsoft 365 and Windows 11. And we plan to make Microsoft 365 Basic even better with advanced security features like ransomware recovery and password-protected sharing links in OneDrive later in 2023. Microsoft 365 Basic will cost only USD19.99 per year and be available worldwide on January 30, 2023, through Microsoft’s website and from the OneDrive and Outlook apps.1 Existing OneDrive 100 GB subscribers will also automatically transition to Microsoft 365 Basic on January 30, 2023.",

Microsoft 365 has benefitted multiple people worldwide. Tools like Microsoft Word are go-to solutions for many businesses, and students also gain significant value. But despite Microsoft 365’s many benefits, some have perceived it not always to be the most affordable tool. Now, however, that is changing. The company is kicking off 2023 with a $2 per month Basic plan, and here’s everything you need to know. Whether you’re considering purchasing Microsoft 365 for the first plan or you want to downgrade an existing subscription, knowing what you get with Basic is a good idea. In the subsections below, we’ll cover the most important areas of consideration. If you frequently use Microsoft 365’s products, you’ll want to ensure that you have enough space in the cloud. And with Microsoft 365 Basic, you get precisely that. After purchasing a Microsoft 365 Basic subscription, you can store up to 100 GB in your OneDrive cloud. This should be more than enough for your Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and so on. The 100 GB of storage is on par with Google One, which costs the same amount per month. Of course, you probably want a premium Microsoft subscription to access all of the most important tools. And when you sign up for Microsoft 365 Basic, you will get precisely that.",

Known back then as Office 365 Home Premium, the plan included access to Office desktop apps and 20GB of cloud storage. That’s been increased to 1TB of cloud storage these days, alongside a bunch of features added to the subscription. “One thing hasn’t changed over the last 10 years: the price,” writes Microsoft vice president Liat Ben-Zur in a blog post. “Microsoft 365 Personal and Family still cost only $6.99 and $9.99 per month, respectively.” While inflation and costs have been pushing up other subscription services over the past decade, Microsoft says it doesn’t have any immediate plans to raise Microsoft 365 prices, but Oystryk doesn’t rule it out for the future.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

The existing Microsoft 365 plans are relatively affordable, but you might not want to purchase a subscription if you’re not going to use all of its features. Luckily, you’ll soon be able to mitigate that. For those who want something simple, Microsoft 365 Basic will fill that gap. Microsoft 365 Basic provides access to the main Microsoft programs, including Word and PowerPoint. On top of that, you’ll get a good level of storage in OneDrive.

If you have a small business with less than 300 users, then the most interesting plans are the Microsoft 365 Business plans. Large organizations will have to look at the Office 365 Enterprise and Microsoft 365 plans. I have also written a couple of articles where I go more into detail between the different plans, you can find the links further down in the article. The table below will help you to compare the Office 365 plans. The prices are based on an annual subscription model. Enterprise plans are only available in a yearly agreement. For most small businesses is the Microsoft 365 Business Standard plan the best choice. With a price of $12.50 per user per month, you get the full Office 365 suite, with the desktop apps, Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc. Everything you need to get your business started in the cloud.

To coincide with the introduction of the new tier, Microsoft today announced the general availability of the Microsoft 365 app, which replaces the Microsoft Office app with a new design and new features. As previewed earlier this year during Microsoft’s Ignite conference, the Microsoft 365 app — now live on the web — provides quick access to apps including Word, Excel and PowerPoint in addition to file templates, “smart” recommendations, to-do list functionality and syncing across different devices. The Microsoft 365 app will launch on Windows, Android and iOS later this month, Microsoft says. Rounding out the raft of new apps and services, Microsoft 365 users will soon be able to view, manage and upgrade cloud storage across devices via a new “simplified view,” says the company. Starting February 1 from a Microsoft account, Windows settings or app settings, subscribers can mange and upgrade their cloud file and photo storage. The investment in Microsoft 365 makes sense.

Microsoft 365 has benefitted multiple people worldwide. Tools like Microsoft Word are go-to solutions for many businesses, and students also gain significant value.

Known back then as Office 365 Home Premium, the plan included access to Office desktop apps and 20GB of cloud storage. That’s been increased to 1TB of cloud storage these days, alongside a bunch of features added to the subscription. “One thing hasn’t changed over the last 10 years: the price,” writes Microsoft vice president Liat Ben-Zur in a blog post. “Microsoft 365 Personal and Family still cost only $6.99 and $9.99 per month, respectively.” While inflation and costs have been pushing up other subscription services over the past decade, Microsoft says it doesn’t have any immediate plans to raise Microsoft 365 prices, but Oystryk doesn’t rule it out for the future.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

By Jason Zinoman When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It was not surprising when Quentin Tarantino, an auteur unusually willing to criticize the work of his peers in public, told an interviewer that he didn’t like the original “Scream,” calling its director, Wes Craven, “the iron chain attached to its ankle.” An ungenerous observer might see a connection between this opinion and the fact that Craven hated Tarantino’s first movie, “Reservoir Dogs,” so much that he walked out of a screening, only to be surprised by the director himself, asking what Craven thought. Side note: Never do that to a director or a critic. Timing matters. While “Scream” has become the most beloved franchise about horror fandom, with scary-movie obsessives as victims or killers or both, there have always been die-hards who felt its self-referential humor came at the expense of the scares; it was fun slasher-lite, spoofing its audience while really pandering to them.

As usual, the film opens with a call from Ghostface, who would like to play a game, this time elevating the horror nerd trivia to the level of the ivory tower, with references to a 20th century slasher-film studies class taught at Blackmore. From the beginning, it’s a Ghostface inception, the copycats folding into themselves, unclear who is targeting whom and why. The closest analogue to “Scream VI” is “Scream 2,” which is directly stated by the film’s resident Randy (the first “Scream’s” horror expert and audience surrogate), his niece Mindy (Jasmin Savoy Brown). Both films leave the high school setting for college, introduce new characters and tangle with the academic side of horror. It’s bigger, shaggier and a bit messier than its predecessor, and while it bears other fun similarities to “Scream 2,” mentioning more ventures into spoiler territory. The script of this team’s previous “Scream” outing felt a bit more incisive, cutting straight to the heart of the toxic fanboy matter.",

Potential labor force productivity is the ratio of real potential GDP to the potential labor force. The bars show average annual growth rates over the specified periods. Those rates are calculated using calendar year data. GDP = gross domestic product. Potential output is an estimate of the economy’s maximum sustainable level of production and indicates high rates of use of labor and capital, but it is not a strict constraint: Actual output can exceed potential output for a time, creating a positive output gap. Over an extended period, however, a positive output gap puts upward pressure on wages and prices, ultimately leading monetary authorities to take steps to relieve inflationary pressures. In response, the growth of output slows, bringing it closer in line with potential output. That process is reflected in CBO’s projection of a gradually narrowing positive output gap after mid-2023.

Global environmental problems cannot be solved without China’s engagement. China’s growing economy is also an important source of global demand. Its economic rebalancing will create new opportunities for manufacturing exporters, though it may reduce demand for commodities over the medium-term. China is a growing influence on other developing economies through trade, investment, and ideas. Many of the complex development challenges that China faces are relevant to other countries, including transitioning to a new growth model, rapid aging, building a cost-effective health system, and promoting a lower-carbon energy path. Following China’s swift reopening after the COVID-19 outbreaks in late 2022, GDP growth is expected to rebound to 5.1 percent in 2023, from 3 percent in 2022. Growth will be led by a recovery in demand, particularly for services. Investment is expected to remain robust, supported by slower but sustained growth in infrastructure and manufacturing investment, as well as the gradual stabilization of property investment.

Familiar faces from the franchise are also set to appear in the film's second installment, plus several newcomers.

Billy Batson will have his hands full as the kid-turned-adult superhero will square off against a new villain with plans that will likely cause some mayhem. Mirren has been adding a lot more big-budget action films to her already impressive filmography, having starred in The Fate of the Furious, Hobbs & Shaw, the upcoming F9, and in the movie adaptation of DC’s Red and its sequel Red 2.  Shazam! saw Billy Batson and his superhero alter ego dealing with new powers and a villain who wanted to steal Billy’s powers for himself. In Shazam! Fury of the Gods, Billy will be up against a new kind of villain, one who is likely far more formidable foe than Sivana ever was. While plot details are currently under wraps, it has been announced Mirren will play Hespera, the daughter of the god Atlas. What Hespera is plotting and what she’s after remains to be seen, but it’s apt that a goddess has been cast considering the title of the sequel.",

The actor playing this character is none other than Michael Gray. In the 1970s, there was a TV series adaptation of Shazam! that starred Gray as Billy Batson. In Shazam! Fury of the Gods, Gray is seen wearing the same red shirt with yellow collar and cuffs as his character Billy Batson in the TV show.

One of the most exciting developments for the sequel is the expanded roles of Billy's foster siblings who were given superpowers in the climax of Shazam! The first film was very much about Billy Batson and his time with the superpowers, but now with the sequel, his foster family get an expanded role and is allowed to be part of the superheroics. Billy Batson and his foster siblings make up the superhero team typically known as the Shazam Family. They have been major parts of various comic books, and three of the members are recent additions to the comics. Here is a breakdown of the Shazam Family in the comics and the films and a little information on each member of the team and who plays them.

At the end of the film, he makes the ultimate sacrifice to protect the world and is rewarded with a happy ending as Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot in a brief cameo) resurrects him and reunites him with his loving family.  A mid-credits scene attached to the movie seems to indicate he’ll be back for more! Maybe even with Wonder Woman in some capacity. But it’s not that simple ... Fury of The Gods’ mid-credits scene opens with two agents walking and talking about how Amanda Waller, the character played by Viola Davis who commands the Suicide Squad and Justice Society, told them to be careful when recruiting their next target. He’s apparently very powerful, one of the most powerful forces they’ve ever come into contact with. That target? Billy Batson/Shazam. We find Billy doing some target practice with empty soda cans, zapping each one with lightning bolts. Waller’s operatives tell him that she’d like him to join the “Justice ...” before Billy cuts them off. He says yes, thinking they’re recruiting him to be part of the Justice League. They correct Billy, telling him that it’s not the Justice League, but rather the similar-sounding Justice Society. Billy is confused, wondering why someone would give the teams such similar names.

Levi, who plays Billy’s alter-ego Shazam (also known as Captain Marvel), and Adam Brody, who plays “Super Freddy” (AKA Captain Marvel Jr., Elvis’ favorite super-guy), both stand out as adolescents struggling with thankless grown-up feelings and responsibilities. The movie’s adult villains don’t stand out, though Mirren still smirks like a champ.    There are signs of a warmer and cleverer adolescent super-drama throughout “Shazam! Fury of the Gods.” Clearly enunicated and frantically declaimed dialogue hints at Billy’s prevailing fear of “aging out of” his family, especially now that he’s about to turn 18 years old. His other family members also have lives to live, but we only catch glimpses of them whenever the plot stalls long enough to highlight likable but under-developed supporting characters, like the unicorn-loving Darla (Faithe Herman) or the closeted Pedro (Jovan Armand), both of whom graze the heart-strings with focus-group-level efficiency.     “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” might have been better if it were more focused on both Billy and Freddy and their hormonal anxieties.",

The first projects announced have veered away from spotlighting DC’s most famous heroes — Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman — and instead will share focus with characters like Super Girl, Swamp Thing, and the superhero group known as The Authority. There are stories involving DC’s big three, but they’ll either feature a different era of that superhero’s life (a Superman reboot movie is in the works) or feature that hero in a roundabout way (a TV show about Themyscira, the Amazon island where Wonder Woman was born, is scheduled but it doesn’t seem that Wonder Woman will be a central character in it).  Fury of the Gods’ credits scene seems to have been made before the overhaul, since it’s now teasing a team that isn’t part of the Gunn-Safran schedule. Billy Batson’s future in the Justice League (he’s a member in the comic books) as well as his future in the DC cinematic universe seems to be in doubt. It’s not a good time to be a Shazam fan.

The 2019 film stuck with the New 52 versions of the characters. Unlike Billy Batson who gets his powers from the wizard, the other members of the family technically get their powers from Billy which means they are sharing in the ability. While each member has all the same powers, each one also is stronger in one specific area corresponding with one of the six figures that give Billy Batson his powers. Those are Solomon (wisdom), Hercules (strength), Atlas (stamina), Zeus (power), Achilles (courage), and Mercury (speed). The main hero of the team, Billy Batson, was a young kid in the foster system who was looking for his birth mother. He is given the powers by a wizard named Shazam.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Zegler read on for the role through Zoom with Sandberg and Dylan Grazer, doing a chemistry test with the latter, who was instrumental in her casting due to Safran giving him the option to choose and Dylan Grazer chose Zegler out of admiration for her work in the West Side Story (1961) remake.[31] Safran was producing the film through his company the Safran Company, while Geoff Johns was also set to produce.[30] Johns was ultimately credited as an executive producer.",

Unfortunately, it's far too early to tell what her role is or how she'll connect with the others. We're excited to see these powerhouse women on-screen. As of 2022, Mirren and Liu have never been in a movie together, so this is an extremely exciting development.

Atlas doesn’t have any daughters in the comics, but DC’s films and TV shows have been known to change stories and characters depending on the plot.  Mirren is a fantastic actress who brings nuance to each of her roles. She’s got a wide range of film credits to her name and will no doubt bring her talent and experience to the role of Hespera in Shazam! Fury of the Gods. In the first film, Dr. Thaddeus Sivana was the primary antagonist. Sivana was a scientist and a regular human, whereas Hespera is most certainly not. Her presence will likely prove a bigger challenge to Billy and his superhero crew. Plus, Mirren’s villain, being a demi-god and all, will probably offer a touch more of the gods’ mythology as it pertains to Shazam! and the DCEU, which seems to be delving more into this lore. Through Hespera, Fury of the Gods could further explore the gods and how they operate. Surely there’s a more expansive world that has yet to be tapped into and Hespera may be the gateway to developing Shazam’s mythology.  Perhaps Billy will learn more about the source of his powers.",

Mirren is set to once again play Magdalene Shaw in F9, which is racing to theaters on June 25. Shazam! Fury of the Gods is set to electrify DC movie fans when it premieres on Nov. 4, 2022.   Get first access to never-before-seen videos, exclusive interviews, and much more!

In August 2022, the final release date of March 17, 2023 was announced.  In June 2020, Marta Milans confirmed that she would reprise her role as foster mother Rosa Vásquez from the first film, and revealed that filming had been delayed by the pandemic.[15] The film's title was revealed to be Shazam! Fury of the Gods during the virtual DC FanDome event in August 2020, with returning cast members confirmed including Asher Angel as teenager Billy Batson and Levi as his adult superhero counterpart, Jack Dylan Grazer as Frederick \"Freddy\" Freeman and Adam Brody as his adult counterpart, Faithe Herman as Darla Dudley and Meagan Good as her adult counterpart, Grace Fulton as Mary Bromfield, Ian Chen as Eugene Choi and Ross Butler as his adult counterpart, and Jovan Armand as Pedro Peña with D.

The Flash and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom were moved from 2022 to 2023 to allow time for their visual effects work to be completed, while Shazam! Fury of the Gods was moved up to Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom's previous release date of December 16, 2022, because it would be ready for release earlier.[41] In April, the film's release date was pushed back five days to December 21 to avoid competition with Avatar: The Way of Water.[42] Rizwan Manji was revealed to be appearing as an unnamed character in July 2022. Manji was suggested for the role by Safran, who also produced the DCEU television series Peacemaker in which Manji portrayed Jamil.",
            "negative26": "But, what can be surmised is that Hespera’s story will likely connect with Zegler’s unknown character and, together, they’ll be shaking things up for Billy. Considering the title of the Shazam! sequel includes the fury of multiple gods, it’s possible the titular hero will infuriate them by accidentally stealing something from Hespera and her sisters’ garden. After all, not only did they tend to the golden apple tree in mythology (a gift given to Hera, Zeus’ wife), but the Hesperides also protected a good amount of the gods’ most treasured artifacts. Conversely, Hespera might be annoyed that a kid received the stamina of Atlas and wants it for herself. There are so many ways the plot could use Hespera and whichever way Shazam! Fury of the Gods goes about it will likely include her and her three sisters.",
            "negative27": "Related: Shazam 2 Title Explained: What Fury of the Gods Means But, who exactly is Hespera and how will Mirren’s role shake things up in Shazam 2? Here’s everything to know about the character and her backstory.  Hespera is the daughter of Atlas and will reportedly be the sister to Rachel Zegler’s character, whose name and backstory remain unknown for the time being. Hespera and her sister are described as having possibly ill intentions, according to the casting announcement, though where their loyalties ultimately lie remains unclear. However, this interpretation suggests Hespera may not actually be a full-fledged villain, but rather someone who is undecided or plays both sides of the good-vs-evil debate if it means she gets something out of it. This ambiguity sounds better than Hespera being a one-note villain and allows Mirren to play the role with some mystery involved, likely tricking the audience into thinking her character is a villain, but one who might have the best of intentions at first.   This is the tricky part because Hespera doesn’t actually have a DC counterpart, so there isn’t any direct information one can glean from the comic book pages about her or her history. Being the daughter of Atlas, however, reveals a bit more about her by association.",
            "negative28": "Before being reborn by saying the magic word \"Shazam,\" an acronym of the immortals Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury, this muscled do-gooder in spandex was just a kid named Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel. You remember Billy, a constant runaway from the Philadelphia foster homes he's been forced to endure since his teen mom deserted him. Billy's foster bestie is Freddy (the scene-stealing Jack Dylan Grazer), a kid on crutches with a smart mouth on him. Things have changed for Billy and his orphaned buds -- Mary (Grace Caroline Currey), Eugene (Ian Chen), Pedro (Jovan Armand) and Darla (a fab Faithe Herman) -- ever since the Wizard (Djimon Hounsou) picked him as his successor. \"Put your hands on my staff,\" demanded the Wiz. \"Gross!\" said Billy, in a response that typified the script's \"Deadpool\"-lite irreverence. I'm pleased to report that cheeky attitude still pops through in \"Shazam! Fury of the Gods\" as Billy/Shazam and his kid besties, now in adult superhero bodies -- Adam Brody for Freddy, Meagan Good for Darla, Ross Butler for Eugene,  D.J. Cotrona for Pedro and Currey playing both versions of Mary -- take on their greatest challenge yet.",
            "negative29": "27] The following month, Mark Strong said he was waiting to hear if he would be returning as Dr. Thaddeus Sivana in the sequel.[28] In January 2021, Good said filming would begin that May,[29] and Rachel Zegler was cast in an undisclosed \"key role\" the next month.[30] Following her exhaustive filming schedule for Maria in West Side Story (2021), Zegler booked a meeting with the DCEU casting director Rich Delia, who was thinking about her for Kara Zor-El / Supergirl in The Flash (2023). Zegler lost out to Sasha Calle, but Delia told her that he thought that she could audition for Anthea in the Shazam sequel. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Zegler read on for the role through Zoom with Sandberg and Dylan Grazer, doing a chemistry test with the latter, who was instrumental in her casting due to Safran giving him the option to choose and Dylan Grazer chose Zegler out of admiration for her work in the West Side Story (1961) remake.[31] Safran was producing the film through his company the Safran Company, while Geoff Johns was also set to produce.[30] Johns was ultimately credited as an executive producer.",
            "negative30": "In Greek mythology, Atlas has three nymph daughters who are collectively known as the Hesperides (aka, the Nymphs of the West, Daughters of the Evening, or Atlantides, after their father) and were responsible for giving off light at sunset. Depending on the myth, the number of sisters ranged from anywhere between three to seven, with Hespera typically being included. Together, the sisters tended a garden and protected the golden apple tree. They didn’t get up to much trouble or adventure outside of that.  Besides being Atlas’ daughter and one of the Hesperides, Hespera is known as the goddess of immortality and is relatively neutral on the scale of good and evil. DC Comics and its movies have heavily leaned into the existence of Greek gods. Wonder Woman included Ares and referenced Zeus. Meanwhile, Shazam’s own powers are a mixture of six gods and their attributes, which includes Atlas’ stamina. With the description that Hespera may or may not have bad intentions, one can surmise that Shazam! Fury of the Gods is giving some of Atlas’ characteristics to his daughter.  While Hespera herself is not featured in the comics, Atlas has shown up on several occasions throughout the years. The god is portrayed as being sometimes good or bad, depending on the storyline. This falls in line with Hespera’s Shazam 2 description, which hints that she may or may not have bad intentions.",
            "negative31": "If you’re eagerly awaiting the Shazam's release and just can’t stand not knowing more, we’ve got you covered — here’s a brief look at who Kalypso and Hespera are and how could impact Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Related: Rachel Zegler Adds Weight to Shazam! Wonder Woman Cameo Rumor Fans might not recognize Kalypso because she isn't actually based on any characters from DC Comics. Rather, she takes inspiration from Calypso, one of the fabled daughters of Atlas in Greek mythology. In the mythos, Calypso doesn't get to do much; she lives alone on the island of Ogygia, an isolated little haven often associated with the lost city of Atlantis. Odysseus stumbles upon her home and discovers that it's fragrant and lush, and Calypso attempts to keep him prisoner as her immortal husband. Eventually, Hermes delivers a message from Zeus commanding her to release her captive, to which she laments that the gods hate mortals having affairs with goddesses. Some accounts speculate that Calypso bore Odysseus' children, and others mention that she killed herself in a fit of unrequited love. She didn't play a particularly large role in mythology, but it's said she was able to provide her lover all the tools he needed to craft a boat and get off Ogygia.",
            "negative32": "Sandberg approved the casting, despite the series being set in the same universe as the film, because he thought Manji only had a small role in Peacemaker. He was surprised to learn that Manji has a significant role and appears in the opening title sequence of the series.[19] Peacemaker creator James Gunn suggested that Manji's character in Fury of the Gods could be Jamil's brother.[43] In August, after WarnerMedia merged with Discovery, Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery, the studio delayed the film to March 17, 2023 (again taking Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom's previous release date), to help spread out the marketing and distribution costs for its feature films.[44] This also moved Fury of the Gods away from Avatar: The Way of Water.[45] By the start of November, Sandberg confirmed that the final cut was complete and ready for release.[46]  The final wave of the film's marketing campaign revealed Gal Gadot's cameo appearance as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, reprising her role from prior DCEU. Sandberg was upset by this reveal, as he intended the cameo to be a surprise. The film's mid-credits scene sees Jennifer Holland and Steve Agee reprise their DCEU roles as Emilia Harcourt and John Economos. This scene was originally the post-credits scene of Shazam!",
            "negative33": "The Hesperides have been seen in multiple branches of Greek mythology, and they've interacted with a wide range of gods and demi-gods. Since Mirren's character is also rumored to be a villain in the movie, there's no telling if she's based on any one daughter. She may have loose connections with Hesperia (sometimes called Asterope), whose name roughly translates to 'lightning'. If this is the case, there's a chance her abilities may involve electricity — since Mirren has been seen using her hands rather than a weapon, this theory may have some basis. Regardless, Hespera is supposedly known as the Goddess of Immortality in the film, and it seems she'll be pretty important in Shazam's next adventure. Like Kalypso, Hespera appears to be garbed in regal armor. Interestingly, her color scheme uses gold as opposed to her sister's silver; given the age difference between the actresses, Hespera may be the older of the two and in a higher seat of power. One released photo shows both women without crowns and in Spartan-like red capes, but it's unclear where these costumes fit in the movie. As far as the relationship between Hespera and Kalypso, we're still in the theorizing phase. Their traditional Greek counterparts don't have any connections, and there aren't any stories or myths that bring the two together.",

Billy Batson will have his hands full as the kid-turned-adult superhero will square off against a new villain with plans that will likely cause some mayhem. Mirren has been adding a lot more big-budget action films to her already impressive filmography, having starred in The Fate of the Furious, Hobbs & Shaw, the upcoming F9, and in the movie adaptation of DC’s Red and its sequel Red 2.  Shazam! saw Billy Batson and his superhero alter ego dealing with new powers and a villain who wanted to steal Billy’s powers for himself. In Shazam! Fury of the Gods, Billy will be up against a new kind of villain, one who is likely far more formidable foe than Sivana ever was. While plot details are currently under wraps, it has been announced Mirren will play Hespera, the daughter of the god Atlas. What Hespera is plotting and what she’s after remains to be seen, but it’s apt that a goddess has been cast considering the title of the sequel."

Here are 10 albums that prove this. Kassa Overall is tired of talking about the connections between jazz and rap. He had to do it when he released his last two albums, and he has to do it again regarding his latest one. \"They go together naturally,\" he once said. \"They're from the same tree as far as where they come from, which is Black music in America. You don't have to over-mix them. It goes together already.\" Expand this outward, and it applies to all Black American musics; it's not a stretch to connect gospel and blues, nor soul and R&B. Accordingly, jazz and rap contain much of the same DNA — from their rhythmic complexity to its improvisational component to its emphasis on the performer's personality. Whether in sampling, the rhythmic backbone, or any number of other facets, jazz and rap have always been simpatico; just watch this video of the ‘40s and ‘50s vocal group the Jubilaries, which is billed as the “first rap song” and is currently circling TikTok. And as Overall points out to GRAMMY.",
            "negative20": "The Grammy Award for Best Rap Album is an award presented to recording artists for quality albums with rapping at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.[1] Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".[2]  In 1995, the Academy announced the addition of the award category Best Rap Album.[3] The first award was presented to the group Naughty by Nature at the 38th Grammy Awards the following year. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented for \"albums containing at least 51% playing time of tracks with newly recorded rapped performances\".[4] Award recipients often include the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists.[5]  As of 2023, Eminem holds the record for the most wins in this category, with six. Lauryn Hill was the first female artist to win in this category, when she won in 1997 with the Fugees. Cardi B became the first solo female rapper to win for Invasion of Privacy.",

By no means I am not trying to tear down DJ Khaled’s musical efforts — but I believe there are more deserving records. “You & Me” by Gunna and Chloë would have been a superior selection. In this specific category, it’s clear voters enjoyed this song regardless of its charting position, as every other song was top-five on the Billboard Hot 100. In any event, someone tell Punch that we are more than ready for SZA’s new album. For what it’s worth, I heard “WAIT FOR U” on TikTok and on a number of other short-form videos more than probably any other song this year. A very easy selection. “First Class” was a hit the moment Jack Harlow teased it, and it remains a singalong song no matter how you slice it. It’s catchier than a fast food jingle. I was surprised to see “Big Energy” nominated, but I am elated for Latto because it’s always an unfairly uphill battle for women to get nominated for rap Grammys. She deserves an upset W, but I think Best Melodic Rap Performance will come down to “First Class” and “WAIT FOR U,” and my guess is that Harlow prevails. Now here is an award for which I have no idea what will win.",

In no way are either of the two albums superior musical achievements to, for instance, Gunna’s DS4Ever, Vince Staples’ Ramona Park Broke My Heart, or JID’s The Forever Story. Even Saba’s Few Good Things or Chris Patrick’s X-Files would have felt more justified. Jack Harlow has had an incredible rise to stardom, but Come Home the Kids Miss You is simply not his best offering. For its part, it’s arguable that GOD DID made more noise due to DJ Khaled’s comical social media antics ahead of its release than it actually did on our playlists or in bars, clubs, and parties across the globe. At this point in his career, Future is playing 1-on-1 against himself. Does he have better projects than I Never Liked You? Yes. Does I Never Liked You still deserve a nomination? Yes. Two things can be true. King Push’s It’s Almost Dry is another quality offering from the lyrical cocaine king, but that brings me to my next point… As it relates to this award, I would place an unhealthy amount of money on Kendrick walking away with the golden megaphone.

            "negative26": "I don’t think that streak will come to an end next year. Yes, this is all subjective. The subjective nature of music will forever cause endless debates as to what should and should not be nominated when awards season roles around — but JID, Vince Staples, and Gunna all striking out in this category just doesn’t add all the way up. Quite the interesting list of songs earned a Grammy nomination here. I’m not mad at any of the nominees. I’m of the mindset that “Churchill Downs” is nominated because Drake gave Jack Harlow a top 10 Drizzy feature verse ever. Comparing Drizzy’s verse to Harlow’s is like comparing seasoned food to unseasoned food. It’s a bit surprising that “The Heart Part 5” was the pick over a song like “N95.” The former is a more personal and a deeply touching song in opposition to the thunder-like thumping of the latter. I don’t have an ill word to say about “WAIT FOR U” earning a nomination. There’s no question that it deserves the nod. This one doesn’t make it into my personal list of Best Rap Songs. I enjoyed the record the first time it played; I haven’t played it from start to finish since then. Jay-Z washed his competition, the chorus is cool, and that’s all I remember strongly from this eight-minute endeavor of a song. “Pushin P” is the titan among these nominees.",

Canada-born stars PartyNextDoor, The Weeknd and Drake took over rap the same way the Brits took over rock music in the 1960s, and it was made possible by the boundless nature (and unprecedented sonic access) of today’s rap fan.  The emergence of SoundCloud elevated lesser-known talents including Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, 21 Savage, the late Juice Wrld to superstardom at a rapid pace. The era also marked a sonic turn in the industry, which saw artists merge their styles with those of other regions. That’s why artists like Asap Rocky adopted elements of Houston’s chopped-and-screwed sound in his early discography, despite his Harlem origins.",

By Nico Grant and Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public’s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an interview. The cautious rollout is the company’s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to Google’s most lucrative business, its search engine.

The just over an hour-long presentation, which came two days after Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google unveiled a flurry of AI tools for its email, collaboration and cloud software, gave the world a glimpse of what could be China's strongest rival to U.S. research lab OpenAI's ChatGPT. But unlike ChatGPT, which last November launched as a free to use chatbot to the public, Baidu limited the presentation to brief videos that showed Ernie carrying out mathematical calculations, speaking in Chinese dialects and generating a video and image with text prompts. It will only be open for trial to an initial group of users with invitation codes from Thursday, while companies can apply to embed the bot into their products via Baidu's cloud platform, the company said.

Putin, did not invade Ukraine, but “conducted a military conflict.” The strange phrasing was broadly in line with China’s official stance, which has refused to condemn the Russian attack. On Taiwan, Ernie did not pull any punches: The People’s Liberation Army is ready for battle, will take all necessary measures and is determined to thwart external interference and “Taiwan independence” separatist attempts. ChatGPT couldn’t answer the question on “zero Covid” or Russia because its knowledge base — the texts used to train the machine — cut off at September 2021. ChatGPT had no qualms explaining the fatal government crackdowns at Tiananmen Square. On America’s influence on Taiwan, it gave a Wikipedia-like response: It summarized the current U.S.",

But according to a story in tech publication The Register, the three companies have now asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that the plaintiff’s cannot prove any harm from having their code used in the training and, as a result, don’t have standing to sue. Colombian judge uses ChatGPT to write part of a court ruling in legal first. The Colombian judge in Cartagena wrote that he had used the OpenAI chatbot to help draft his verdict in a case about whether an insurance company had to cover a child’s medical treatments, Vice reported. The judge said he posed legal questions to the A.I. system and included its responses verbatim in the opinion. But he also added his own judicial insights and said he mostly used the A.I. to “extend the arguments of the adopted decision.” ChatGPT is known to fabricate some information it returns in response to queries and OpenAI, its creator, has said the A.I. should not be used for anything with serious consequences. DeepMind finds a way to make sampling from LLMs faster and cheaper. The Alphabet-owned research company published a paper on a way to make it 2-2.5 times faster to get a sample of generated text from a large language model (LLM).",
            "negative22": "LLMs are the things that underpin most of the advances in natural language processing, including ChatGPT. DeepMind’s approach, called “speculative sampling,” involved actually creating a small model that creates a draft output and then using the larger, more capable model to score that draft output. Output tokens that the small and large model both agree on are then accepted for the final output. Given the importance of LLMs right now, and how expensive it is to train and run these huge models, this paper might have some big and immediate commercial implications, helping the companies working on LLMs to potentially lower the cost of running the models.

By Nico Grant and Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public’s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an interview. The cautious rollout is the company’s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to Google’s most lucrative business, its search engine. Many in the tech industry believe that Google — more than any other big tech company — has a lot to lose and to gain from A.I.",
            "evidences2": "China's Baidu unveiled its much-awaited artificial intelligence-powered chatbot known as Ernie Bot on Thursday, but disappointed investors with its use of pre-recorded videos and the lack of a public launch, sending its shares tumbling. The just over an hour-long presentation, which came two days after Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google unveiled a flurry of AI tools for its email, collaboration and cloud software, gave the world a glimpse of what could be China's strongest rival to U.S. research lab OpenAI's ChatGPT. But unlike ChatGPT, which last November launched as a free to use chatbot to the public, Baidu limited the presentation to brief videos that showed Ernie carrying out mathematical calculations, speaking in Chinese dialects and generating a video and image with text prompts. It will only be open for trial to an initial group of users with invitation codes from Thursday, while companies can apply to embed the bot into their products via Baidu's cloud platform, the company said. Baidu's Hong Kong shares (9888.HK) tumbled as much as 10% while its CEO Robin Li spoke and eventually closed 6.4% lower, shaving over $3 billion off the Chinese search engine giant's market valuation."

Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions, called \"prompts\", similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. The tool is currently in open beta, which it entered on July 12, 2022. The Midjourney team is led by David Holz, who co-founded Leap Motion. Holz told The Register in August 2022 that the company was already profitable. Users create artwork with Midjourney using Discord bot commands. Midjourney, Inc. was founded in San Francisco, California by David Holz, previously co-founder of Leap Motion. The Midjourney image generation platform first entered open beta on July 12, 2022. However, on March 14, 2022, the Discord server launched with a request to post high-quality photographs to Twitter/Reddit for system's training.

Mostaque was born on April 1983 to a Bengali Muslim family in Jordan. He was taken to Dhaka, Bangladesh a month after his birth, and migrated with his family to the United Kingdom at the age of seven. He is a graduate of the University of Oxford.  At age 19, Mostaque met his wife while on a student trip to the United States. He has been diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD. In his twenties, he became interested in helping the Islamic world by creating online forums for Muslim communities and developing \"Islamic AI\" which would help guide people on their religious journey. After graduating, Mostaque went on to spend 13 years working at various hedge funds in the United Kingdom.  In 2019 Mostaque founded Symmitree, a startup that aimed to reduce the cost of technology for individuals living in poverty, which he worked on for 1 year. In late 2020 Mostaque founded Stability AI.  Much of the company's funding comes directly from Mostaque, as well as other investment companies such as Eros Investments.",

What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset.

So we’re constantly talking to people.

It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet.

Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels.

            "negative6": "So far though, Holz said there hadn't been any complaints, what's more, some famous artists who use the platform say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.” But if the problem does arise, Holz said the team is open to it, although they don’t have a process for that yet. Speaking of art style, Midjourney has some distinguishing features no other tool like this has. It's \"artistic\" in a way that the generated images look like paintings and never like photos. \"We definitely want it to not look like photos. We might make a realistic version at one point, but we wouldn’t want it to be the default. Perfect photos make me a little uncomfortable right now, though I could see legitimate reasons why you might want something more realistic.\" Midjourney's style is \"whimsical and abstract and weird.\" Holz shared that it has favorite colors (it uses a lot of blues and oranges) and faces. The developers don’t know why it happens, \"but there’s a particular woman’s face it likes to draw\" – people call it “Miss Journey.",
            "negative7": "The hardest part of [a commercial art project] is often at the beginning, when the stakeholder doesn’t know what they want and has to see some ideas to react to. Midjourney can help people converge on the idea they want much more quickly, because iterating on those concepts is very laborious. Another advantage for artists is it gives people confidence in areas they’re not confident in. Most if not all artists feel like there’s some part of art they can’t do well. It might be colors, composition, backgrounds. We have a famous character designer using our product and people ask him why would you use an AI since you’re so good already. And he said, “well, I’m only good at the character part. This is helping me build out the rest of the world.” About how many people are using the product? Millions are using it. Our Discord is over two million. It’s the biggest active Discord server by far now. Does Midjourney’s license allow for commercial use of imagery generated by the platform? Yes. But if you’re working for a company bigger than a million dollars in annual revenue, we ask that you buy a corporate license. How was the dataset built? It’s just a big scrape of the Internet. We use the open data sets that are published and train across those. And I’d say that’s something that 100% of people do. We weren’t picky.",
            "negative8": "\"They're using it as an emotional and intellectual reflective tool,\" he said. \"And that's really cool.\" Holz dislikes the idea of using Midjourney to create fake photographs. \"Using it editorially to create fake photos is extremely dangerous,\" he said. \"No one should do that.\" But he's more open to Midjourney as a source of commercial illustration, noting that The Economist ran a Midjourney graphic on its cover in June. \"We only recently allowed people to use it commercially,\" said Holz. \"For a long time, it was non-commercial only. And so one of the things we're doing is we're just watching it, what people are doing, and we might decide that we're not comfortable with some of that and then we're going to put in a rule saying you can no longer use it just for those things.\" Holz said he sees AI tools like Midjourney making artists better at what they do rather than making everyone a professional artist. \"An artist using these tools is always better than a regular person using these tools. At some point, might there be pressure to use these tools because you can make things that are so great? I think yes. But right now, I don't think it's quite there yet. But it will get shockingly better over the next two years.",
            "negative9": "It's probably the most expensive … if you call Midjourney, a service – like you'd call it a service or a product – without a doubt, there has never been a service before where a regular person is using this much compute.\" Yet Midjourney isn't on the path toward upselling customers brought in by a free service to paid tiers and then attracting well-paying enterprise clients before going public or getting acquired. \"We're not like a startup that raises a lot of money and then isn't sure what their business or product is and loses money for a long time,\" said Holz. \"We're like a self-funded research lab. We can lose some amount of money. We don't have like $100 million of somebody else's money to lose. To be honest, we're already profitable, and we're fine.\" \"It's a pretty simple business model, which is, do people enjoy using it? Then if they do, they have to pay the cost of using it because the raw cost is actually quite expensive. And then we add a percentage on top of that, which is hopefully enough to feed and house us. And so that's what we're doing.\" As for the future, scaling could be a problem. Holz said Midjourney presently has hundreds of thousands of people using the service, which requires something like 10,000 servers.",
            "negative10": "\"If there were 10 million people trying to use technology like this,\" he said, \"there actually aren't enough computers. There aren't a million free servers to do AI in the world. I think the world will run out of computers before the technology actually gets to everybody who wants to use it.\" What are people using it for? Well, if you are signed in to a Midjourney account you can see what people are creating via the Community Feed page. It's a constant flow of interesting, often startling good, images. Little cloud house 2 #midjourney #aiartcommunity pic.twitter.com/uL9WlJDMC6 \"The majority of people are just having fun,\" said Holz. \"I think that's the biggest thing because it's not actually about art, it's about imagination.\" But for about 30 percent of users, it's professional. Holz said a lot of graphic artists use Midjourney as part of their concept development workflow. They generate a few variations on an idea and present it to clients to see which direction they should pursue. \"The professionals are using it to supercharge their creative or communication process,\" Holz explained. \"And then a lot of people were just playing with it.\" Maybe 20 percent of people use Midjourney for what Holz describes as art therapy. For example, creating dog images after their dog has died.",
            "negative11": "That aside, the company does intend to build out the existing product with more enhanced features, thereby making the output more realistic and nuanced.  In addition, Midjourney’s technology uses a combination of its own models and open-source codes to create art. Holz’s near-term goal is to stop using open-source products and create the codes 100% in-house.  “I feel like there are people in technology who basically act like we have no past, and there’s a lot of people in the world in fear of not having a future. But I feel like the truth is we’re actually very much mid-journey,” Holz said. “We have this beautiful and rich history behind us, and an equally rich wonderful future ahead of us,” Holz concluded on an optimistic note, hinting at AI’s promise of limitless possibilities and the company’s ethos.” VentureBeat's mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact.

The two category judges were unaware that Midjourney used AI to generate images, although they later said that had they known this, they would have awarded Allen the top prize anyway.[28]  In December 2022, Midjourney was used to create the images in an AI-generated children's book in the span of a weekend. Titled Alice and Sparkle, the book features a young girl who builds a robot that becomes self-aware. The creator, Ammaar Reeshi, spent hours tweaking Midjourney prompts, rejecting hundreds of generated results to ultimately choose 13 illustrations for the book.[29] Both the product and process drew criticism: \"the main problem... is that it was trained off of artists’ work. It’s our creations, our distinct styles that we created, that we did not consent to being used,\" one artist wrote.[30]  In 2023, the realism of AI-based text-to-image generators, such as Midjourney, DALL-E, or Stable Diffusion,[31][32] reached such a high level that it led to a significant wave of viral AI-generated photos.",

            "negative16": "“Coming from the IA [intelligence augmentation] school of thought, I’ve always been more interested in empowering people and trying to make people better.”  Like many experts in AI who believe in using machines to perform tasks that humans would consider intelligent or smart —and experts in IA, who place humans at the center of the system and use technology to support and complement human cognitive functions, Holz chose a path that would let him enjoy the best of both worlds.  “Over the years, I’ve realized that we can use AI to empower people and to make people better and those people can make better AI — it’s like coming full circle and everyone wins,” he said.  Leap Motion transpired out of this ideology. The company developed an optical hand tracking module that captures the movements of human hands using AI. “The goal wasn’t to replace a sign language person, but it was to allow us to literally be embodied in virtual spaces inside of computers. And now, with Midjourney, we are not trying to replace an artist but are giving them tools to explore new mediums of thought and expand their imaginative powers,” Holz explained.  In 2021, Holz started Midjourney as an independent research lab. Around the same time, industry buzzwords like ‘diffusion models’ and ‘contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP)’ were on everyone’s lips.  Building on these developments, the lab began offering its text-to-image service in 2022.",
            "negative17": "“Our technology is moving so fast that it makes sense to focus on the consumer side because that’s where people can just take things and run. Also, there’s something very simple and beautiful about making a cool thing,” Holz said. “It only gets better when regular people can pay and have fun with it while professionals pay less than they would for an enterprise product, and still enjoy the product and use it for work. I think this simplicity is worth a lot and we want to keep it.”  While the world believes that the next phase of text-to-image evolution will move towardfull-blown videos or movies, Midjourney begs to differ. In fact, the company might avoid that as much as possible — as incorporating text-to-video capabilities could make the product more expensive and the output could be a dealbreaker, if it’s not thoroughly thought through.  That said, Holz does plan to take things to the next level via text-to-3D. He detailed Midjourney’s quest to make the output more real and move towards augmented and virtual reality. It aspires to bring the liquid imagination to the real world.  “I care about three things: Reflection, coordination and imagination. To make a better world, we need to be more reflective, more imaginative and we need to be better at coordinating. And I want to build something big in each area, and then bring them together one day,” he said.",

I'm living a good banker life. But with Midjourney now I'm actually starting to get a taste of this experience of being the person I actually wanted to be.” Or a guy at the truck stop who’s making his own baseball cards with wild Japanese styles, just for fun. It's made for those people, because, like most people, they don't ever get to do these things. It's important to emphasize that this is not about art. This is about imagination. Imagination is sometimes used for art but it's often not. Most of the images created on Midjourney aren’t being used professionally. They aren’t even being shared. They’re just being used for these other purposes, these very human needs. Nevertheless, the output of your product is imagery, which has commercial value in professional context in addition to all of those other properties. And this is very disruptive of that economy.

            "negative19": "Similar to its counterparts, the AI system accepts a design prompt or idea in the form of a phrase and uses it as inspiration to create captivating images. Midjourney stands out because the AI bot can only be accessed via the voice over Internet protocol, instant messaging social platform, Discord — rather than via its own website or mobile app.  When a natural language query is issued, the bot responds with four low-resolution images in about 60 seconds. Users can generate variants and new generations at this point to get closer to their desired ideation. Users can change the aspect ratio of the prompt with a maximum resolution of 2048×1280 pixels, much higher than DALL-E 2’s 1024×1024 resolution.  Close-up photographs of discrete objects, pop culture references, charcoal or pencil sketches, paintings in the styles of various renowned artists — Midjourney can do it all. It’s exceptional at creating larger-than-life scenes.  As to the competition, Holz said, “I don’t really want to spend too much time comparing ourselves to others. I like to hope that the results speak for themselves. Kind of like how Apple doesn’t spend all their time talking about how Android sucks.”  Given the grand scale on which Midjourney performs, artists and researchers alike have begun expressing concerns about this technology’s collateral damage. Of the many questions raised, three garnered much attention:  Holz addressed the three, extensively, below: No, it cannot.",
            "negative20": "It might be different for other [AI image] generators because they try to make something look like the exact thing. But we have more of a default style, so it really does look like an art student being inspired by something else. And the reason we do that is because you always have defaults, so if you say “dog,” we could give you a photo of a dog, but that’s boring. From a human standpoint, why would you want that? Just go to Google image search. So we try to make things look artistic.  That’s something you’ve mentioned a few times in our conversation — the default art style of Midjourney — and I’m really fascinated by this idea that each AI image generator is its own microcosm of culture, with its own preferences and expressions. How would you describe Midjourney’s particular style, and how have you consciously developed it?  [Laughing] It’s a little ad hoc! We try lots of things, and every time we try a new thing, we render out a thousand images. And there’s not really an intention to it. It should look generally beautiful. It should respond to specific things and vague things. We definitely want it to not look like photos. We might make a realistic version at one point, but we wouldn’t want it to be the default. Perfect photos make me a little uncomfortable right now, though I could see legitimate reasons why you might want something more realistic.",
            "negative21": "Midjourney and DALL-E 2 have drawn more attention to longstanding concerns about whether large AI models, created from the work under copyright or specific licenses, can be reconciled with copyright law and with content creators' own sense of how their work should be treated. In terms of Midjourney output, current US jurisprudence denies the possibility of granting copyright to AI-generated images. In February, the US Copyright Office Review Board rejected [PDF] a second request to grant copyright to a computer-generated landscape titled \"A Recent Entrance to Paradise\" because it was created without human authorship. In a phone interview, Tyler Ochoa, a professor in the Law department at Santa Clara University, told The Register, \"The US Copyright Office has said it's [acceptable] if an artist uses AI to assist them in creating a work as long as there's some human creativity involved. If it's simply you typing text, and the AI generates a work, that pretty clearly is not subject to copyright protection under current law.\" Midjourney's Terms of Service state \"you own all Assets you create with the Services,\" but the company requires a copyright license from users to reproduce content created with the service – a necessary precaution to host users' images, even if it looks doubtful that those making Midjourney images simply through text input have any copyrights to convey or enforce. That may not always be the case.",
            "negative22": "Widespread attention was gained by a Midjourney-generated photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat,[33][34] the fictional arrest of Donald Trump,[35] and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon,[36] as well as the usage in professional creative arts.[37][38]  Research has suggested that the images Midjourney generates can be biased.[39] For example, even \"neutral\" prompts in one study returned unequal results on the aspects of gender, skin color, and location.  Prior to May 2023, Midjourney implemented a moderation mechanism predicated on a \"banned words\" system. This method prohibited the use of language associated with explicit content, such as sexual or pornographic themes, as well as extreme violence. Moreover, the system also banned certain individual words including religious and political figures such as \"Allah\" or \"Xi Jinping\". This practice occasionally stirred controversy due to perceived instances of censorship within the midjourney platform.[40]  Commencing in May 2023, with subsequent updates post version 5, Midjourney transitioned to an \"AI-powered\" content moderation system. This advanced mechanism allowed for a more nuanced interpretation of user prompts by analyzing them in their entirety. It consequently facilitated the context-dependent use of words that had previously been prohibited. For instance, users can now prompt the AI to generate a portrait of \"Xi Jinping\".",
            "negative23": "“They think that the better they can get at copying their personal art style, the more useful it is. Whereas if it has its own style, they have to kind of meet it halfway and pull their stuff out of it. Which is interesting. It’s a little scary for me because I see how it could be used for good and evil.” As Midjourney is intended to be open by default, it has strict policies on ensuring that content is PG-13. It automatically blocks text inputs that are inherently disrespectful, aggressive, abusive or sexual, Holz confirmed Most importantly, the rules are enforced for all content, including interactions in private mode.  Midjourney currently offers a limited “freemium” model that allows users to submit 20-25 prompts for image generation. After that, users can choose from a range of subscription packages — ranging from a basic membership package of 200 images, a standard membership, which includes unlimited images — or a premium corporate membership, which includes both unlimited images and complete privacy.  It’s important to note that “corporate membership” does not refer to an enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) product. In fact, Holz explicitly mentioned that the company has no interest in building one either, even though they have many customers who use the product to make commercial video games, concept art and videos.",

The tranche values the company at $1 billion post-money, according to a Bloomberg source, and comes as the demand for AI-powered content generation accelerates. London- and San Francisco–based Stability AI is the brainchild of CEO Emad Mostaque. Having graduated from Oxford with a master’s in mathematics and computer science, he served as an analyst at various hedge funds before shifting gears to more public-facing works. Mostaque co-founded and bootstrapped Stability AI in 2020, motivated both by a personal fascination with AI and what he characterized as a lack of “organization” within the open source AI community. “Nobody has any voting rights except our employees — no billionaires, big funds, governments or anyone else with control of the company or the communities we support. We’re completely independent,” Mostaque told TechCrunch in a previous interview. “We plan to use our compute to accelerate open source, foundational AI.” Stability AI has a cluster of more than 4,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs running in AWS, which it uses to train AI systems, including Stable Diffusion.",
            "negative26": "While Stability AI’s business strategy still remains fuzzy, in a recent interview with ML enthusiast and YouTuber Yannic Kilcher, Mostaque said that he is already in talks with “governments and large organizations” to offer Stable Diffusion’s tech. “We’ve negotiated a large number of deals, so we’ll be profitable at the door, compared to large corporations that lose most of their money,” he added. “At Coatue, we believe that open-source AI technologies have the power to unlock human creativity and achieve a broader good,” explained Sri Viswanath, general partner at Coatue. “Stability AI is a big idea that dreams beyond the immediate applications of AI.

Stable Diffusion, a free, open-source text-to-image generator that the company helped train, changed the world’s understanding of AI’s potential when it launched in August. But Stability AI soon found itself at the center of debate—and copyright lawsuits—over how it trains those tools on data (and art) pulled from the internet. Still, the company says that within a month of launching Stable Diffusion 2.0, it powered four of the App Store’s top 10 apps.

            "negative30": "Following a string of abandoned startups (including a crypto project centered on a digitized Quran), Mostaque founded Stability in 2019 as an AI-powered data hub that global agencies would use to make decisions about Covid-19. It launched with a July 2020 virtual event featuring talks by Stanford AI expert Fei-Fei Li and representatives from UNESCO, WHO and the World Bank. But the project failed to get off the ground and was scrapped about a year later. “Lots of people promised a lot and they didn’t come through,” Mostaque told Forbes in January. “One thing you learned from that is if you have a company with a huge press department, you can rebrand history in your interest.”  The company’s focus shifted several more times. Early employees said they researched building a network of vending machine refrigerators around London that would be stocked with grab-and-go items, as well as a line of emotional support dog NFTs (Snoop Dogg was interested, employees recollect Mostaque claiming around the office; the rapper could not be reached for comment). When generative AI started exploding, Mostaque saw an opportunity. Through a variety of maneuvers and exaggerations, he would successfully position Stability as one of the leading unicorn AI companies of the moment. To get there, Mostaque began telling investors that Stability was assembling one of the world’s 10 biggest supercomputers.",

In December, Google issued a \"code red\" to employees amid the rising popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which may threaten its search engine. Employees at the company were asked to pivot to developing AI prototypes and products that can generate art, The New York Times reported.

It also offers a platform and API, DreamStudio, through which its models can be accessed by individual users — Mostaque told Bloomberg that DreamStudio has more than 1.5 million users who’ve created over 170 million images and Stable Diffusion has more than 10 million daily users “across all channels.” Meanwhile, the open source version of Stable Diffusion has been downloaded more than 200,000 times, according to a press release published by Stability AI this morning. According to Mostaque, the capital from the funding round will support deploying custom versions of Stable Diffusion for users at a larger scale and investing in more supercomputing power. It’ll also be put toward hiring more people, with Mostaque saying he expects to grow to about 300 employees from 100 over the next year. Stability AI has made several high-profile hires recently, bringing on research scientists from Google Brain and futurist and public speaker Daniel Jeffries.",

His message to staff: \"You're all going to die in 2023.\" A new Forbes report details how Emad Mostaque — who founded Stability AI, a company that creates open-source AI tools, in 2020 — is preparing to go up against fellow startup OpenAI, as well as behemoths like Google and Meta, in 2023 as tech companies race to release commercialized AI products. In August, Stability AI released Stable Diffusion, an open-source AI text-to-image generator, to the public. According to Forbes, Stable Diffusion is used by 10 million people each day — more than the number who use OpenAI's DALL-E 2, which was released to the public in July. \"Stable Diffusion threw a bomb into the mix by making things dramatically more accessible,\" Pat Grady, an investor at venture capital firm Sequoia, told Forbes. \"It really lit a fire under OpenAI and got them to become much more commercially focused.\"  Stable Diffusion uses diffusion, a generative AI technique that teaches an AI model to destroy and then reconstruct an image. After the art generator took off, Stability AI raised a seed round of as much as $100 million at a $1 billion valuation.",
            "negative34": "Emad Mostaque is the modern-day Renaissance man who kicked off the AI gold rush. The Oxford master’s degree holder is an award-winning hedge fund manager, a trusted confidant to the United Nations and the tech founder behind Stable Diffusion — the text-to-image generator that broke the internet last summer and, in his words, pressured OpenAI to launch ChatGPT, the bot that mainstreamed AI. Now he’s one of the faces of the generative AI wave and has secured more than $100 million to pursue his vision of building a truly open AI that he dreams will transform Hollywood, democratize education and vanquish PowerPoint. “Hopefully they’ll give me a Nobel Peace Prize for that,” he joked in a January interview with Forbes. At least, that’s the way that he tells the story. In reality, Mostaque has a bachelor’s degree, not a master’s degree from Oxford. The hedge fund’s banner year was followed by one so poor that it shut down months later. The U.N. hasn’t worked with him for years. And while Stable Diffusion was the main reason for his own startup Stability AI’s ascent to prominence, its source code was written by a different group of researchers. “Stability, as far as I know, did not even know about this thing when we created it,” Björn Ommer, the professor who led the research, told Forbes. “They jumped on this wagon only later on.",
            "negative35": "The last version of the model published by the original developers (released in October 2022) received three times as many downloads last month on Hugging Face, which hosts the models, as compared to the most popular version published in-house by Stability. And StableLM, its ChatGPT competitor, was released in April to a tiny fraction of Stable Diffusion's fanfare. Mostaque is unfazed. Stability has a seasoned technical leader to spearhead research: himself. He claims to have discovered a bespoke medical treatment for autism years ago by using AI to analyze existing scientific literature and build a knowledge graph of molecular compounds. (Bishara said the research was done privately and declined to elaborate further.) “I’m a good programmer,” Mostaque told Forbes in January. It all dates back to a gap year he said he took before Oxford to be a developer at software company Metaswitch, he continued. “I didn’t know how to program before that, so I taught myself over the summer — quite naturally actually,” he says. By his account, he submitted several pieces of code and made a personal plea to the company: “I want to be a programmer and you should pay me to be a programmer. They said sure.” “I can be quite convincing at times,” he says. This story has been updated to note Stability AI’s denial that Amazon threatened to revoke access to GPUs.",
            "negative36": "“The investment thesis that we had is that we don’t know exactly what all the use cases will be, but we know that this technology is truly transformative and has reached a tipping point in terms of what it can do,” Gaurav Gupta, the Lightspeed partner who led the investment, told Forbes in a January interview. Coatue and Lightspeed declined requests for further comment. Mostaque says Stability is building bespoke AI models for dozens of customers. But he told Forbes that he is only authorized to name two. The first is Eros Investments, an Indian holding company whose media arm was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and recently settled a lawsuit alleging that it misled investors, though it did not admit wrongdoing. (Eros did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) The second: the African nation Malawi, where, Mostaque said on a recent podcast appearance, Stability is currently “deploying four million tablets to every child.” (Malawi’s government did not return requests for comment.) Less than two months after Stable Diffusion's public launch, Mostaque claimed that Stability's annualized revenue was higher than the “low tens of millions of dollars” that OpenAI was reportedly making at the time. Sources familiar with the matter said Stability’s ARR is now less than $10 million — and that it's far outpaced by the startup's burn rate. Like many AI startups raising vast amounts of cash right now, it will need more money to stay afloat.",
            "negative37": "“What he is good at is taking other people’s work and putting his name on it, or doing stuff that you can’t check if it’s true.”  These aren’t the only misleading stories Mostaque, 40, has told to maneuver himself to the forefront of what some are calling the greatest technological sea change since the internet — despite having no formal experience in the field of artificial intelligence. Interviews with 13 current and former employees and more than two dozen investors, collaborators and former colleagues, as well as pitch decks and internal documents, suggest his recent success has been bolstered by exaggeration and dubious claims. After Stable Diffusion went viral last summer, blue-chip venture capital firms Coatue Management and Lightspeed Venture Partners poured in $100 million, giving Mostaque’s London-based startup a $1 billion valuation. By October, Stable Diffusion had 10 million daily users, Mostaque told Bloomberg. In May, the White House named Stability alongside Microsoft and Nvidia as one of the seven “leading AI developers” which would collaborate on a landmark federal AI safety initiative. Mostaque recently dined with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos; reclusive Google cofounder Sergey Brin made a rare public appearance at Stability’s ritzy launch party in San Francisco last October.

More premier talent has followed since the cash injection last summer. Among the 140-person staff: a vice president of research and development who was a Nvidia director; another research head who came from Google Brain; and three Ph.D. students from Ommer’s lab. But to build buzz around Stability, Mostaque made an elaborate gambit supported by exaggerated claims and promises, overstating his role in several major AI projects and embellishing a quotidian transaction with the notoriously uncompromising Amazon into a “strategic partnership” with an 80% discount. AI researchers with whom Mostaque worked told Forbes he claimed credit he did not earn or deserve. And when pressed, Stability spokesperson Motez Bishara admitted to Forbes that Stability had no special deal with Amazon. Mostaque’s other mischaracterizations to investors include multiple fundraising decks seen by Forbes that presented the OECD, WHO and World Bank as Stability’s partners at the time — which all three organizations deny. Bishara said the company could not comment on the presentations “without knowing the exact version,” but that they were accompanied by additional data and documentation.",

And Getty Images banned the upload of content generated by systems like Stable Diffusion, over fears of intellectual property disputes.

Stability AI was even the subject of a recent critical letter from U.S. House Representative Anna G.

This supercomputer, Mostaque said, was built from thousands of Nvidia’s state-of-the-art GPUs and purchased with a stunning 80% discount from Amazon Web Services. Five fundraising pitch decks from May to August 2022 list AWS as a “strategic partner” or “partner.” “We talked to Amazon and said this will be the big thing,” Mostaque told Forbes from his bustling London headquarters in January. “They cut us an incredibly attractive deal — certain personal guarantees and other things, which I don’t particularly want to go into because she’ll be angry at me,” he explained, nodding to Zehra Qureshi, his wife and Stability’s then-head of PR. Qureshi declined to elaborate. But Bratin Saha, a vice president for the Seattle tech giant’s AI arm, told Forbes in January that Stability is “accessing AWS infrastructure no different than what our other customers do.” Three former Stability employees said that prior to its venture capital injection, Amazon had threatened to revoke the company’s access to some of its GPUs because it had racked up millions in bills that had gone unpaid for months.",
            "negative44": "Bishara denied that Mostaque made this directive, but these organizations are indeed listed as “partners” in multiple fundraising decks as recent as August 2022, in which Mostaque also describes himself as the “UN Covid AI lead.” A UNESCO spokesperson said the UN agency had no association with Stability beyond the Covid-19 data initiative, which had ended well before last summer. The other three agencies said they had no record of official partnerships with the company. Asked about the claims in Stability’s pitch decks, Bishara said that all of Stability’s investor decks included investment memos and appendix documentation that contained more context on the Amazon deal and details of “our relationship with partners and more.” But two investors pitched by the company told Forbes they received no such additional information. In June 2022, Mostaque offered to provide Stability’s supercomputer to a group of German academics who had created an open-sourced image generator nicknamed Latent Diffusion. This model had launched seven months prior in collaboration with a New York City-based AI startup called Runway. But it was trained using only a few dozen Nvidia GPUs, according to Björn Ommer, the professor who led the research teams at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Heidelberg University. For the researchers, who were facing shockingly high computing costs to do their work, the proposal seemed to them a no-brainer. The computing boost Stability provided dramatically improved Latent Diffusion’s performance.",
            "negative45": "In August, the new model was launched as Stable Diffusion, a new name that referenced its benefactor. Stability issued a press release and Mostaque positioned himself in the public eye as chief evangelist for what he calls “the most popular open source software ever.” (Linux or Firefox might disagree.) “What he is good at is taking other people’s work and putting his name on it, or doing stuff that you can’t check if it’s true,” one former employee said of Mostaque. In a statement, Bishara said Mostaque is “quick to praise and attribute the work of collaborators” and “categorically denies these spurious claims and characterizations.” Within days of Stable Diffusion’s launch, Stability secured $100 million from leading tech investment firms Coatue and Lightspeed — eight times the amount of money Mostaque set out to raise, he declared in text messages to his earlier investors. Both firms declined requests for comment. “The investment thesis that we had is that we don’t know exactly what all the use cases will be, but we know that this technology is truly transformative and has reached a tipping point in terms of what it can do.”  The round valued Stability at $1 billion though the company hadn’t yet generated much revenue.

            "negative47": "A press release announcing its funding said “Stability AI is the company behind Stable Diffusion” making no reference whatsoever to its creators. Ommer told Forbes he’d hoped to publicize his lab’s work, but his university’s entire press department was on vacation at the time. Bishara said that Stability has made “repeated public statements” crediting Ludwig Maximilian University and Runway on its website and on the Stable Diffusion’s GitHub page. Nevertheless, the original developers feel Mostaque misled the public in key communications. “One thing you learned from that is if you have a company with a huge press department, you can rebrand history in your interest,” Ommer said. In October, Stability claimed Runway had stolen its intellectual property by releasing a new version of Stable Diffusion. Runway cofounder Cristóbal Valenzuela snapped back that a copyright breach wasn’t possible because the tech was open source; Mostaque retracted a takedown request hours later. He later told Forbes that he was worried about the lack of guardrails in Runway’s version — though Stable Diffusion’s collaborators don’t buy the excuse. The incident, Ommer said, “pushed it too far over the edge.” Valenzuela was equally disillusioned. \"New people are coming into this field that we’ve been in for years, and really trying to own narratives that they should not,” he told Forbes in an interview last year (he declined a request for further comment).",
            "negative48": "Inside the company, wages and payroll taxes have been repeatedly delayed or unpaid, according to eight former employees, and last year the UK tax agency threatened to seize company assets. (“There were several issues that were expeditiously resolved,” Bishara said.) At the same time that workers faced payday uncertainties, Mostaque’s wife Zehra Qureshi, who was head of PR and later assumed a seat on the company’s board of directors, transferred tens of thousands of pounds out of the company’s bank account, per several sources and screenshots of financial transactions viewed by Forbes. Stability spokesperson Bishara said the spouses had been “making loans to and from the business” and that “any amounts owed from or to Mostaque and Qureshi were settled in full before the end of 2022.” In responding to a detailed list of questions, Mostaque shared a statement saying that Stability had not historically prioritized the “systems and processes” underpinning the fast-growing startup. “We recognize our flaws, and we are working to improve and resolve these issues in an effective and compassionate manner,” he wrote. AI experts and prospective investors have been privately expressing doubts about some of Mostaque’s claims for months now. Despite Silicon Valley’s sudden, insatiable appetite for AI startups, a number of venture capitalists told Forbes that the Stability founder has been struggling to raise hundreds of millions more in cash at a roughly $4 billion valuation.",
            "negative49": "In January, Mostaque implied that the company was having no issues with fundraising: “We have been offered by many, many entities and we’ve said no,” he told Forbes. But three venture capitalists told Forbes he has been pitching them and other investors on raising a fresh $400 million for several months; they’d all passed. (Bishara declined to comment on revenue, but said the company has “significant” cash reserves remaining.) Stability is also facing a pair of lawsuits which accuse it of violating copyright law to train its technology. It filed a motion to dismiss one from a class action of artists on grounds that the artists failed to identify any specific instances of infringement. In response to the other, from Getty Images, it said Delaware — where the suit was filed — lacked jurisdiction and has moved to change the location to Northern California or dismiss the case outright. Both motions are pending court review. Bishara declined to comment on both suits. In an open letter last September, Democratic representative Anna Eshoo urged action in Washington against the open source nature of Stable Diffusion. The model, she wrote, had been used to generate images of “violently beaten Asian women” and “pornography, some of which portray real people.” Bishara said newer versions of Stable Diffusion filter data for “potentially unsafe content, helping to prevent users from generating harmful images in the first place.” AI research has not come easy for Stability — even on its flagship Stable Diffusion product.",
            "negative50": "Head over to our on-demand library to view sessions from VB Transform 2023. Register Here  There’s no shortage of groundbreaking technology underpinning generative AI, but one key innovation is is diffusion models. Inspired by thermodynamic concepts, diffusion models have piqued the public interest, quickly displacing generative adversarial networks (GANs) as the go-to method for AI-based image generation.  These models learn by corrupting their training data with incrementally added noise and then determining how to reverse this noising process in order to recover the original image. After being trained, diffusion models can use these denoising methods to generate new “clean” data from random input. Popular text-to-image generators such as DALL-E 2, Imagen and Midjourney all use diffusion models. Another key entrant in this category is Stability AI, the startup behind the Stable Diffusion model, a powerful, free and open-source text-to-image generator that launched in August 2022.  Founded in 2020 by Emad Mostaque, Stability AI claims to be the world’s first community-driven, open-source artificial intelligence (AI) company that aims to solve the lack of “organization” within the open-source AI community.   “AI promises to solve some of humanity’s biggest challenges. But we will only realize this potential if the technology is open and accessible to all,” said Mostaque.",

The oversubscribed round was led by Coatue, Lightspeed Venture Partners and O’Shaughnessy Ventures LLC. In a statement, Stability AI said that it will use the funding to accelerate the development of open-source AI models for image, language, audio, video, 3D and more, for consumer and enterprise use cases globally. Much like most of its counterparts, Stable Diffusion aims to enable billions of people to instantly create stunning art. The model itself is based on the work of the CompVis and Runway teams in their widely used latent diffusion model, as well as insights from Stability AI’s lead generative AI developer Katherine Crowson’s conditional diffusion models, Dall-E 2 by OpenAI, Imagen by Google Brain, and many others. The core dataset was trained on LAION-Aesthetics, a subset of LAION-5B, which was created using a new CLIP-based model that filtered LAION-5B based on how “beautiful” an image was, based on ratings from Stable Diffusion’s alpha testers.",

He was taken to Dhaka, Bangladesh a month after his birth, and migrated with his family to the United Kingdom at the age of seven. He is a graduate of the University of Oxford.  At age 19, Mostaque met his wife while on a student trip to the United States. He has been diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD. In his twenties, he became interested in helping the Islamic world by creating online forums for Muslim communities and developing \"Islamic AI\" which would help guide people on their religious journey. After graduating, Mostaque went on to spend 13 years working at various hedge funds in the United Kingdom.  In 2019 Mostaque founded Symmitree, a startup that aimed to reduce the cost of technology for individuals living in poverty, which he worked on for 1 year.

But Pinterest was slow to embrace shopping and buying features, slow to embrace the creator economy, and generally slow to keep up with the future of commerce. Ready, on the other hand, has a long track record of being ahead of the game in e-commerce. He was a top executive at both Venmo and PayPal before going to Google in 2020 to run its various commerce projects. Google Shopping definitely hasn’t taken over the world in the last two years, but Ready definitely had an impact: commerce became a core part of YouTube’s future, Google revamped the way Shopping works, and the company reinvested in its payment systems like Wallet.  And now, Ready seems to have big commerce plans for Pinterest. “In the next phase of our journey, we will help people engage more deeply with all the inspiring products and services they find on our platform so they can build their best lives,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing his move. “As someone who has spent most of my career in commerce and payments, it’s so clear to me that Pinterest has the opportunity to build something unique—something special.",

Pinterest’s ad tech partnerships have already started benefiting advertisers, which positions the company for increased revenues in the future, UBS analysts said in the report. Ready’s revamped advertising strategy includes partnering with companies that can improve Pinterest’s targeting and measurement capabilities. It is already working with LiveRamp, a California-based software company, to develop clean rooms, or digital spaces where advertisers and Pinterest can share their data. The LiveRamp partnership alone has made Pinterest’s ads more effective, and it has opened the door for collaborations with other businesses, UBS analysts said. A future partnership with Google, Ready’s former employer, could be a massive boost for the platform, they said. Since Ready joined Pinterest, the company rolled out a tool called whole page optimization, which increased the number of ads a user sees when they are shopping on the app. With this launch, Pinterest earns revenue from showing more ads, and users see more relevant ads.",

Musk also said at the time that he expected an organizational restructuring of Twitter to be completed in the next week or so. It’s been nearly six months since he said that. Bantering with Twitter followers late last year, Musk expressed pessimism about the prospects for a new CEO, saying that person “must like pain a lot” to run a company that “has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy.” “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

            "negative25": "“Rival companies smell blood in the water,” Uzzi says. “They’re going to be pushing hard to try to gain success while Twitter’s been weakened.”  Twitter has also become less relevant, Enberg says. “Even before Musk, Twitter’s cultural relevance was declining. Its user base is already tiny compared to Facebook, Instagram and TikTok and smaller now that Musk has taken over,” Enberg adds.  In recent months, Enberg says that Musk has made decisions that suggest he might be angling Twitter towards a new life as a broader media company. Hiring Yaccarino, who has a background in streaming and TV could help him to achieve this. But some moves Musk has made with Twitter, such as hosting Florida governor Ron DeSantis’s presidential candidacy announcement on Twitter Spaces, and allowing Tucker Carlson to launch a show on the platform following his ouster from Fox News, are could cause problems for Yaccarino.  “Musk is clearly amplifying far-right voices as well as controversial content,” says Enberg. “It’s going to impact Twitter’s ability to be able to generate ad revenues in the future. Enberg adds that Yaccarino and Musk might be most successful if they both focus on their respective strengths.",
            "negative26": "Yaccarino spoke this month to Thomas Kurian, the head of Google Cloud, to resolve the issue and ordered the bill paid, a person familiar with the conversation said. She also persuaded Mr. Musk to embrace the new developments, the person said. Google declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported earlier that Twitter had resumed paying Google. Ms. Yaccarino has also tried reaching out more to Twitter’s work force, which has shrunk more than 75 percent through layoffs and other departures since Mr. Musk bought the company. Twitter framed a copy of one of her motivational tweets about “wearing 4 inch heels” while working as an executive and hung it in a dining common area in the San Francisco office. She has also held happy hours there and in New York, four current and former employees said. And she has been relentlessly optimistic in her conversations, two of those people said. In her meeting with the sales team this month, Ms. Yaccarino said Twitter had an “opportunity that comes out of being challenged the last bunch of months.” “Point me in the right directions,” she said. “I know what it’s going to take.\" Ryan Mac is a technology reporter focused on corporate accountability across the global tech industry.

            "negative27": "Business Insider reported last month that the numbers were even more dismal than Musk has said publicly, and that Twitter is operating with only 10% of the staff it had before his October takeover.  Musk previously said that workers would need to be “extremely hardcore,” logging “long hours at high intensity” and that the cuts, which spanned teams ranging from content moderation to engineering, resulted in “some of the people who were let go probably shouldn’t have been” he told CNBC in May.  Musk said that he and Yaccarino would be looking to grow the company again. “We absolutely need to hire people,” Musk told CNBC. “And if they’re not too mad at us probably rehire some of the people that were let go.” Whether Yaccarino will be able to staff up again remains uncertain, especially given that the company is not yet breaking even. “Twitter as an organization is not positioned to hire new people. What you read in the media is that it can’t even pay the bills it has now. How is it going to hire new people?” says Uzzi.  Experts say that, as Twitter deals with its growing pains, competing services might try to move in while the company is struggling. A range of competitors, from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s Bluesky to Instagram’s text-based app expected to launch this summer, are looking to populate the market.",
            "negative28": "In December, Musk floated the idea of stepping down as Twitter's CEO. He polled his Twitter followers and nearly 58% of respondents supported him leaving his role as the social media site's leader.  Since Musk took over Twitter, around 90% of its employees have been fired or have quit. He has saddled the company with debt, just as advertisers have fled in droves. Musk himself has raised the possibility of bankruptcy if Twitter can not turn around its financial outlook.  Musk has ruled the embattled site erratically, making policy decisions that affect the whole platform on a whim and rapidly introducing a dizzying array of changes, including stripping users of \"verified\" blue check marks and allowing anyone to purchase a \"verified\" badge. Notably, he reactivated former President Donald Trump's account, which had been \"permanently suspended\" for inciting violence after the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol. He has welcomed back on the platform right-wing users and other controversial figures who had also been previously barred violating policies rules against harassment and violent speech.  It is unclear if Musk's successor will continue to carry out his mandate of relaxing content moderation rules and attempting to find new ways to generate revenue on the ailing platform.  Musk, who also leads Tesla and SpaceX, has faced criticism for neglecting his role at his other companies with Twitter consuming much of his attention.",
            "negative29": "“In this partnership, if [Musk] can now focus on what he does best, which is product development… and empower Yaccarino to handle the business side of things, I do think this could be a really fruitful relationship and a win for Twitter, which is something that it hasn’t had in a long time.” Write to Simmone Shah at simmone.shah@time.com.",
            "negative30": "“Even though there’s skepticism and all marketers live in the ‘show me’ state right now with regard to Twitter, if in fact she does go to Twitter this is a powerfully reassuring move.” Proulx added that advertising is not the only challenge that Twitter’s new CEO will face – after all, Musk has “fundamentally altered” Twitter both as a product and a community, arguably “for the worse.” Musk’s tenure at Twitter’s helm has been chaotic. He began his first day firing the company’s top executives, followed by roughly 80% of its staff, which has meant that Twitter has far fewer engineers to ensure that the site is running smoothly and far fewer content moderators to help rid it of hate speech, animal cruelty and graphic violence. He’s upended the platform’s verification system and has scaled back safeguards against the spread of misinformation. It’s been some of these changes — along with Musk’s own penchant for spreading misinformation and engaging with prominent conspiracy theorists and far-right figures — that analysts say soured many advertisers on the platform. Regaining advertisers’ trust will require stabilizing Twitter and ensuring that key product decisions are made thoughtfully and deliberately and not, as Musk has often been known to do, on the spur of the moment, inspired by a fan’s tweet or a passing thought.",
            "negative31": "Even in the best of times, Twitter was an also-ran in the digital ad space compared to tech giants like Meta and Google, with a smaller user base and less sophisticated ad targeting technology. And Musk’s takeover came as many advertisers have pulled back their digital ad spending across the board during a precarious moment for the economy. That could only add to the difficulty Yaccarino will face in shoring up Twitter’s business.             Musk, for his part, has been attempting to supplement, and potentially largely replace, Twitter’s ad business with subscriptions, but it appears that only a tiny fraction of Twitter users have bought in. The selection of Yaccarino suggests a recognition on his part that the company he bet $44 billion on will continue to be reliant on ad sales for the foreseeable future.            It’s unclear how much freedom Yaccarino will have to hire additional staff to support her likely remit to revive advertising on Twitter after Musk laid off around 80% of the company’s staff last year. And even if she is able to hire, top talent may be wary of joining Twitter after Musk upended the company’s culture and reportedly rolled back benefits like work-from-home and extended parental leave.             “Personnel is going to be a huge challenge for her … if tech workers are looking for a stable working environment, they will probably stay away from Twitter,” Hubbard said.",
            "negative32": "“Unless there are fundamental changes at Twitter, I don’t think [the leadership change] is going to have the immediate effect that Elon is hoping it will have.”             Twitter did not respond to a request for comment on this story.            The Musk issue was on full display at NBCU’s ad upfront this week, which was held shortly after Yaccarino resigned from the company following rumors of her appointment as Twitter’s CEO. On stage at the event, which aimed to promote NBCU’s platforms to advertisers, a talking bear sang to audience members: “Twitter may seem like the place to begin, but Twitter just let all the crazies back in.”            Even if Musk pulls back on his tweeting, a feat he seems constitutionally incapable of achieving, it will be no easy task for Yaccarino to revive Twitter’s advertising business — let alone expand it.            Many major advertisers left the platform following Musk’s takeover over concerns about an uptick of hate speech, frustrations over layoffs of much of the company’s ad and safety teams and general uncertainty about the platform’s future. Just 43% of Twitter’s top 1,000 advertisers as of September, the month before Musk’s takeover, were still advertising on the platform as of last month, according to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.            But for many, leaving Twitter may not have been a particularly difficult call.",
            "negative33": "The electric car company accounts for most of Musk's wealth, but investors of his other companies have complained that running Twitter has become a major distraction. Tesla's stock lost 65% of its value in 2022. After the tweet promising a new Twitter CEO was posted, Tesla's stock price shot up, perhaps a sign that investors believe Musk may soon turn his focus back to Tesla. In December, Tesla investor Ross Gerber told Tesla's board of directors to \"wake up.\"  Gerber added in the tweet: \"Who is running Tesla and when is Elon coming back?",
            "negative34": "Musk last month told CNBC he “didn’t care” if his controversial tweets drew the ire of Twitter advertisers or Tesla shareholders. “I’ll say what I want to say, and if the consequence of that is losing money, so be it,” he said.             Even without the CEO title, Musk will retain significant control over Twitter as its owner. He has said he will oversee product, technology and software and systems operations, and will also transition to being the company’s executive chairman.            Yaccarino’s first day coincided with a Twitter Spaces livestream event Musk hosted with Democratic presidential hopeful and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, after a similar event Musk held with Ron DeSantis last month was largely overshadowed by technical glitches.           At the event, Musk lamented Twitter’s fraught relationship with advertisers. Musk told Kennedy that Twitter had lost billions of dollars in advertising revenue due to Musk’s approach to content moderation on the social platform.           “It’s definitely been extremely difficult,” Musk said. “Basically, our revenue is cut in half because we didn’t toe the line.”           The Spaces conversation, which drew more than 60,000 listeners at its peak, was hosted by Musk, Kennedy and tech investor David Sacks.            Musk discussed the financial toll advertising boycotts have had on his business, saying it’s been a “huge struggle for Twitter to break even.”",
            "negative35": "In December, Musk ran a poll on the platform asking users whether he should step back as Twitter’s CEO, which ended with the majority of users voting in the affirmative.            Musk is likely betting on Yaccarino’s ad industry chops to restore Twitter’s flagging advertising business.            On Monday, the New York Times reported that Twitter’s US advertising revenue from the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was down 59% year-over-year, citing an internal presentation. (CNN has not viewed the presentation.)            Just 43% of Twitter’s top 1,000 advertisers as of September, the month before Musk’s takeover, were still advertising on the platform as of April, according to data provided to CNN by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower last month.            Reversing that decline could prove to be an uphill battle: Twitter’s ad business has declined sharply since Musk’s takeover due to advertiser concerns over hate speech on the platform, mass layoffs at the company and general uncertainty about Twitter’s future direction.            Yaccarino’s takeover comes just days after the resignation of Twitter’s head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, who confirmed her exit in a tweet Friday.            Yaccarino may also struggle to rein in Musk, whose tweets and policy decisions often generate controversy.",
            "negative36": "Yaccarino — at least initially — from working on advertising deals that would conflict with the interests of her former employer, three people familiar with the arrangement said. It is all part of an adjustment as Ms. Yaccarino settles into her new role and reports to a new boss. After working for traditional media organizations in New York for decades, she is now helping to lead a San Francisco-based social media company that has undergone rapid changes under Mr. Musk, who bought Twitter last year. Restricted from hammering out advertising deals, Ms. Yaccarino has instead repaired at least one relationship, between Twitter and Google; talked with regulators; and focused on employee morale. She has held happy hours and tried rallying workers with mission statements and more internal communication. “Twitter is on a mission to become the world’s most accurate real-time information source and a global town square for communication,” she wrote this month in her first companywide email, which The New York Times obtained. “We’re on the precipice of making history.” Twitter did not make Ms. Yaccarino, a longtime Madison Avenue power player, available for an interview. A person close to her said the noncompete clause extended only for her first few weeks at Twitter, while another said it was difficult for NBCUniversal to enforce. The clause’s expiration date was unclear. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Ms.",
            "negative37": "From September to October of last year, Twitter’s top 10 advertisers dropped spending 89% from $71 million to $7.6 million, according to estimates from research firm Sensor Tower. Twitter’s ad revenue from April 1 to the first week of May was down 59% from the year before, the New York Times reported.  “Ultimately, the goal [is] trying to convince the CMOs [chief marketing officers] that it’s worthy to have Twitter within their mix and that they won’t be stuck waking up to a negative headline the next day,” Salmon says.  Enberg predicts Musk will stand back and let Yaccarino leverage the contacts she has from decades in the industry. “That is one area where I don’t think Musk is going to stand as much in Yaccarino’s way because by appointing her CEO, he is acknowledging without actually saying the words that Twitter’s ad business is in a dismal state and he is just not the right person to fix it.” To placate advertisers, experts say that Yaccarino will likely have to strike a balance between Musk’s vision for free speech and the internal regulation that advertisers would hope to see.",
            "negative38": "Yaccarino also said she would take a different position from Mr. Musk’s rocky relationship with the media. Her strategy, she said, is to “have very good relationships with them so they become our advocates or mouthpieces to amplify our strategies.” But Ms. Yaccarino also made it clear that she knew who was in charge. She referred to Mr. Musk, who was not in attendance, as “the boss.” Two days later, Ms. Yaccarino met with Twitter’s investors and lenders in San Francisco alongside Mr. Musk, a person familiar with the meeting said. Together, they presented their plans for the company to focus more on video, work with influencers and news publishers, and integrate payment capabilities. Reuters reported earlier on the presentation. While Ms. Yaccarino’s noncompete clause with NBC held her back from major advertising discussions, she stayed busy. David Cohen, the chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group, said that he had emailed with Ms. Yaccarino and that she had been on “a kind of fact-finding tour.” She is leveraging her relationships in the advertising industry to discern where Twitter stands on issues such as how to keep ads away from objectionable content, he said, adding, “She’s definitely listening.” Yet when Publicis Groupe, one of the world’s largest advertising agencies, held a conference in Paris on June 16, its chairman interviewed Mr. Musk without Ms.",
            "negative39": "Yaccarino began as Twitter’s chief executive on June 5. Two days earlier, the native Long Islander and longtime New Yorker tweeted a photo of the Manhattan skyline with the message: “Bay Area views coming soon!” She took at least one NBCUniversal colleague with her to Twitter. Mr. Musk had not made a companywide announcement about Ms. Yaccarino’s hiring at Twitter, three employees said. Instead, in an email to the company’s sales team before Ms. Yaccarino started, her appointment was the second bullet point below an update about a new feature for advertisers. Ms. Yaccarino quickly struck an upbeat note at Twitter. At an internal ad sales meeting on June 12, she addressed the state of Twitter’s advertising. Mr. Musk had removed guardrails at the site, allowing misinformation and toxic content to flourish and deterring brands from advertising. The company’s U.S. ad revenue has fallen nearly 60 percent, and Mr. Musk has said he expects revenue this year to be around $3 billion, down from $5.1 billion in 2021. Ms. Yaccarino acknowledged that some “big brands” had stayed away from the platform, according to a recording of the meeting that The Times obtained, and said she and other sales employees would have to engage in “hand-to-hand combat” to persuade them to return. She did not mention her inability at the time to discuss ad deals with clients. Ms.",
            "negative40": "How Elon Musk upended Twitter and his own reputation in 6 months as CEO         In tech, the CEO is often the public face of the brand. But Musk will almost certainly continue to fill that role, with or without the title, likely to Twitter’s detriment.             Just this week, Musk drew backlash for baselessly attacking billionaire George Soros, a frequent target for antisemitic conspiracy theories, saying the financier “hates humanity.” Musk’s Twitter also faced criticism in recent days for removing some tweets and accounts at the behest of Turkey’s government amid the country’s election; the company later said it would object to the removal requests in court.             On Tuesday, Musk said he “didn’t care” if his controversial tweets drew the ire of Twitter advertisers or Tesla shareholders. “I’ll say what I want to say, and if the consequence of that is losing money, so be it,” Musk said in an interview with CNBC.             “The question is: can she help balance [Musk]?” said Tim Hubbard, management professor at University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. He added that top ad buyers are more likely to take calls from Yaccarino than from Musk, who has previously said he hates advertising.             But “the big problem with Twitter right now is, they’re on a pathway that turns advertisers off, turns users off,” Hubbard said.",
            "negative41": "Yaccarino, with deep roots in the advertising industry, could be a linchpin in Twitter’s future.  Luring advertisers is critical for Musk and Twitter after many fled in the early months after his takeover of the social media platform, fearing harm to their brands in the ensuing chaos. Musk said in late April that advertisers had returned, but provided no details.  Mark DiMassimo, founder and creative chief of ad agency DiGo, said Yaccarino successfully integrated and digitized ad sales at Comcast and NBC — and that her track record of cross-selling ads across different platforms could appeal to Musk as he tries to transform Twitter from a social media company to a bigger media platform. Yaccarino worked at NBCUniversal for nearly 12 years — with her team generating more than $100 billion in ad sales since 2011, her company bio notes.  According to LinkedIn, Yaccarino previously served as NBC’s chair for advertising and client partnerships and as president of cable entertainment and digital advertising sales. Prior to her time with NBC, Yaccarino worked at global entertainment company Turner for almost two decades.  Last month, Yaccarino interviewed Musk on a Miami stage last month in front of hundreds of advertisers. “If anyone can translate the Musk vision into advantages for marketers she’ll be able to do it,” DiMassimo said Friday, prior to Musk’s confirmation.",

Some retailers even offered special pre-oder bonuses when pre-ordering from their store. Pre-order Bonus Guide: Where to Pre-order  A Demo version for Splatoon 3 entitled Splatfest World Premiere was available to download on the Nintendo eShop. An online event took place on August 27 where everyone could participate and play the brand new Splatfest battles. Demo GuideSplatfest World Premiere Date and Time The release date for Splatoon 3 was officially announced alongside a gameplay trailer on April 22nd, 2022. The gameplay trailer featured a fast-paced round of Turf Wars, presented a new map, and showcased several new weapons including the Tri-Stringer! Splatoon 3 is the lastest entry to the third-person ink-filled shooter series. The game will be released on September 9th, 2022,  exclusively on the Nintendo Switch family of systems.

The Pikmin 4 reveal trailer was brief and didn’t give us much information outside of a general look at its art and some environments. But we do know that its colorful visuals will return this time around, just like its predecessors. However, its second Direct trailer would go into much more depth. That second clip introduces some of the sequel’s new features. Pikmin 4 will introduce a new ice Pikmin type that’s capable of freezing water, giving all Pikmin safe passage. The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar’s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin. Elsewhere, we see it barreling into obstacles to open up new parts of the world. That aspect is a major departure for the series and should make it stand apart from previous entries. The final Pikmin 4 trailer shows off more aspects of the world, including home interiors.",

Speaking of new Pikmin, the Glow Pikmin will let you explore the world at night — a first for the series. This type only shows up after dark and can combine together into a large green orb to launch at airborne enemies. Finally, the Dandori Battles will let you compete against other players to gather the most objects within the time limit to save the castaway and win. Pikmin 4 is now available to preorder at major retailers and the Nintendo eShop. It’ll cost $60, unlike The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The game will also be eligible to purchase with Nintendo’s Switch Game Voucher system. The Pikmin series has always highlighted the idea of commanding huge numbers of tiny creatures at once.

The plants aren’t alone this time around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles.

            "negative12": "This is mostly a rehash of the premise of the game, which is to use your friendly Pikmin — and new friend Oatchi — to repair your spaceship and rescue any lost explorers you encounter. Pikmin’s gameplay mixes real-time strategy and puzzle elements, often with a time-based mechanic that requires you to gather resources before the sun goes down. There’s often a large stage to explore, with plenty of deadly creatures to battle, along with collectibles and fruit to consume. In it, you control one of the space travelers who can command the Pikmin around the stage. The game’s stages are often varied, taking place on different planets throughout the galaxy. Each Pikmin has different functionality, like the Rock Pikmin, which can be thrown at walls or structures to break them with ease. You use these Pikmin to traverse the levels, which eventually lead to a boss battle. There isn’t anything quite like Pikmin, as it effectively blends strategy, time management, and smart puzzle aspects that give it an original identity. This entry will take that idea further by adding the previously mentioned ice Pikmin type and dog companion, both of which will add new twists to the puzzle-strategy series. Nintendo notes that you’ll have the ability to play from the Pikmin’s perspective, which is a first for the series. Other Pikmin games feature a three-quarter isometric view, allowing you to see plenty on-screen at once.",

The camera allows for a full view of the area around the player character, with the perspective being much closer to the ground than in previous games.[3]  Pikmin 4 retains Pikmin types from previous games, and introduces two new species: Ice Pikmin, which are invulnerable to being frozen and can freeze enemies and bodies of water;[4] and Glow Pikmin, which operate at night and are useable during the Night Time Expeditions. The player can also command a canine creature called Oatchi to help with exploration.[5][4] Like the Pikmin, Oatchi can be directed to carry objects and attack enemies, but can also help bash breakable objects, sniff out objectives such as treasure, and transport both the player character and Pikmin around the map and over bodies of water; in some places, the player can directly control Oatchi to solve puzzles.  The game's single-player mode introduces new features to the series. Players can customize their character with different facial features and uniform colors, and have access to a hub base that provides different activities - such as the ability to upgrade equipment, as well as Oatchi and its abilities after it gains experience during exploration. Treasures collected in different areas contribute to a resource known as Sparklium, which is needed to expand the number of maps the player can explore.",

The game was first revealed in a teaser trailer on 17 February 2021 and was subsequently released on 9 September 2022.

The game's design is themed around chaos due to the outcome of the last Splatfest.[35]  The story mode of Splatoon 3, titled Return of the Mammalians, is set in a new location called Alterna, a large, snowy area littered with incomplete structures and hazardous Fuzzy Ooze, an ink-like substance mostly covered in brown fur, with a rocket at its center.[36] It focuses on the reappearance of mammals, which have been long-extinct.[37]  Upon following the elderly squid Craig Cuttlefish into a crater covered with lethal Fuzzy Ooze, the player is recruited by Cuttlefish into the New Squidbeak Splatoon as Agent 3 along with their pet Salmonid Smallfry known as \"Little Buddy\" . Little Buddy is able to eat and destroy some of the ooze, allowing passage further into the crater.

Players defend Splatsville by fighting invading Salmonids on an online competitive map, instead of the unique stages typically used for Salmon Run. After a few days, the event ends and participating players receive a prize. This event occurs every few months.[27][28] There is also another salmon run event called Eggstra Work where teams compete to get the most golden eggs in a set of 5 waves with the same enemies and weapons.  A new mode present in Splatoon 3 is Tableturf Battle, a digital collectible card game based on Turf War in which players build a deck composed of collected trading cards. In Tableturf Battle, each card can be used to apply a pattern to a grid, and after a \"special attack\" is charged, it can be used to place a pattern that overwrites the opponent's patterns.[29][30]  The Splatoon games take place on a version of Earth set far in the future after the extinction of humanity and almost all mammal life, suggested to be due to climate change,[31][32] where much of oceanic life has evolved to live on land.",

He praised the story mode's lore, as well as its characters, while lamenting the reuse of enemies from previous games. He also reviewed Tableturf Battle, calling it a \"lackluster card game\" that \"consistently ends with a whimper instead of a bang\".[29] Destructoid's Chris Carter also praised how Return of the Mammalians interacted with the game's multiplayer modes, by both teaching the player important mechanics and rewarding them with useful items, as well as appreciating how the story mode was tailored for speedrunning.[18]  Martin Robinson of Eurogamer criticized the lack of significant new content, saying that even the largest new additions are not something \"that can be applauded too enthusiastically\", and other features \"basic [ones] you'd expect of a contemporary online multiplayer game\".",

The Chiefs' defense continued their good form by forcing Philadelphia to their first, and only, three-and-out of the entire game. The ensuing Arryn Siposs punt, however, was a poor one and allowed Kadarius Toney to return it for 65 yards to the Eagles' 5-yard-line and setting a record with the longest punt return in Super Bowl history, surpassing Jordan Norwood’s record of a 61 yard return seven years earlier in Super Bowl 50.",

Butker's extra point increased their lead to eight points.

Hurts then scored a two-point conversion with a run that tied the score at 35 with 5:15 remaining. At the start of Kansas City's next drive, three runs by Pacheco for 15 yards and two completions by Mahomes for 17 yards moved the ball to the Eagles' 43-yard line. On the next play, despite his re-aggrevated ankle injury, Mahomes took off for a 26-yard run - the longest run by any Chiefs player in the game - that gave the Chiefs a first down on Philadelphia's 17-yard line.

However, Chiefs rookie Trent McDuffie then made a crucial tackle on Kenneth Gainwell to keep him in-bounds after a two-yard pass from Hurts, preventing the Eagles from having any chance at throwing to the end-zone before half-time. The Eagles used their final timeout to stop the clock, and Jake Elliott converted the ensuing 35-yard kick to increase Philadelphia's lead to ten points going into halftime.[114]  Kansas City received the ball to begin the second half and drove 75 yards in 12 plays, with Mahomes completing all three of his passes for 26 yards and rushing for 14 before Pacheco's 1-yard touchdown run cut their deficit to three points.

J. Brown. The Chiefs did not recover from a loss of yardage on the first play of their next drive, and they punted as a result of their first three-and-out. After a Hurts pass and a Kenneth Gainwell rush each gained nine yards, Hurts fumbled the ball while running into linebacker Nick Bolton, who recovered it bouncing off the ground in stride and ran 36 yards for a touchdown, tying the game. Hurts led the Eagles on another touchdown drive to take the lead. The Eagles converted a pair of fourth downs, one of them a 4th and 5 with a 28-yard scramble by Hurts, and later by drawing the Chiefs offside on 4th down for the other. Hurts finished the 71-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run that made the score 21–14.

            "negative23": "On the next drive, Mahomes led the Chiefs down the field in nine plays, hitting Kadarius Toney on a 5-yard score for Mahomes' second passing touchdown of the night. Following a record-setting punt return by Toney, Mahomes threw yet another short touchdown on the Chiefs' next offensive drive. The score put the Chiefs up by a touchdown with just over nine minutes to play. The Eagles, however, refused to go out quietly. Hurts led an eight-play touchdown drive to tie things up with five minutes to go. Mahomes then arguably pulled off his most impressive drive of the night. With the game on the line, he led a 12-play drive that took just more than five minutes off the clock. It included a 26-yard scramble by Mahomes. A few plays later, he took a knee at the 9-yard line with 11 seconds left to set up Harrison Butker with the potential winning field goal. Butker made the kick, giving the Chiefs a 38-35 lead with just eight seconds to go. The Eagles could not pull off a miraculous final play, and Mahomes walked away a Super Bowl winner — and Super Bowl MVP — for the second time in his exceptional career.",
            "negative24": "\"A lot of soreness going into halftime, was able to move it around and get taped up a little bit and go play that second half. It didn't feel good, but I was going to leave it all out there. I'm glad it was enough for the win.\" Perhaps all the Chiefs need is doubt -- in the form of a scoreboard deficit -- to find their inner champion. Mahomes authored a stunning comeback in his first Lombardi Trophy-winning performance in Super Bowl LIV, and the spark he provided helped Kansas City overcome a 10-point halftime deficit in his latest triumph. The scramble proved to be the cherry on top of Mahomes' second Super Bowl sundae, setting up ﻿Harrison Butker﻿ for a 27-yard field goal to give the Chiefs the win. \"I wish I'd make it easier and not be down, but I feel like I play better when we are down,\" Mahomes said with a slight smile. \"I'll try to do whatever I can to learn how to not get in those situations and just start fast and finish faster. But you'll back on these games for the rest of your life. ... I'm just glad I get to enjoy it with some of the best men on earth.",
            "negative25": "The proof was in the second-half production, which wasn't gaudy, but was exactly what the Chiefs needed to win: 13-of-14 passing, 93 yards and two crucial touchdowns that not only got the Chiefs back into the game, but gave them a fourth-quarter lead. As Rihanna dazzled the 67,827 in attendance at State Farm Stadium, Mahomes spent time with the Chiefs' training staff, whom Mahomes said afterward did not administer a pain-killing shot, but did help him feel right enough to return to action. \"There's nothing that's going to keep me off that football field,\" Mahomes said during the Super Bowl LVII trophy presentation. Isn't that the truth. Mahomes' guts were on full display late in the game, when he took the field following Philadelphia's quick response to tie the game at 35. With 43 yards between Mahomes and a second Super Bowl triumph and no one to throw to, Mahomes took off down the middle of the field, running with the belief he had a defender right on his heels to the very end of his 26-yard gain. The ankle held up, just as it did in Kansas City's AFC Championship Game win over Cincinnati that sent them to Arizona. \"It felt great until I kind of rolled it a little bit,\" Mahomes said of his ankle afterward.",
            "negative26": "These events combined to make for what Mahomes called a most satisfying championship. \"I wouldn't necessarily say we were counted out, but there were a lot more critics than there were the previous years I've been here,\" Mahomes said. \"At the beginning of the year, I said as long as Andy Reid is coaching, we're going to have success as an offense, and I was trusting the leaders that we have in that defense. \"So to go from a team that I wouldn't even say a majority picked to win the AFC West to win the Super Bowl, that speaks to the guys that we have in that locker room.",
            "negative27": "The league MVP played on a high ankle sprain that he suffered in the divisional round playoff win over the Jacksonville Jaguars and aggravated the injury late in the first half vs. the Eagles. He not only stayed in the game but scrambled for 14 yards on the Chiefs' touchdown drive to begin the second half and for 26 yards on the drive to the game-winning field goal. \"It felt great until I kind of rolled it a little bit,\" Mahomes said. \"I thought I felt really good and then that happened, and I had a lot of soreness going through into halftime and was able to move it around, kind of get taped up a little bit and go out there in that second half. \"It didn't feel good, but I was going to leave it all out there.\" Mahomes' grit was appreciated by his teammates. \"I wasn't distraught or down,\" Chiefs offensive tackle Orlando Brown said of Mahomes' injury. \"It didn't affect the energy or anything like that. We just kind of knew if he's got a little bit of a limp then he's got a little bit of a bigger chip on his shoulder.  \"I don't know how bad it was, but you can never count [Mahomes] out. He's one of the greatest.\" Mahomes also played with the high ankle sprain in the AFC Championship Game victory over the Bengals.",

But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.  And that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable?

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.    How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.",

All of these factors matter when teaching a class.  Whether your learners are baby llamas or adult llamas, you can invest energy in examples and training types that are right for them. Everyone will get more out of the experience.  The llamas aren’t hiking all the time, every day. They don’t do tours in the off-season. So every year, they have to retrain to break down bad habits they’ve developed when they aren’t hanging out with humans every day. The trainers don’t expect llamas to learn it once and remember it forever. We shouldn’t expect that from humans either. Learning is continuous. While right after training, everyone may be very aware of what they are doing and very careful to do it correctly, as time passes we become more comfortable. We might forget what we’ve learned. New challenges may change what we do. That’s why we need to train continuously and retrain when something changes or a lot of time has passed. Everyone needs a refresher now and then to deliver a reliable experience.  They set up every llama for a great, successful hike. If a llama isn’t good with kids, they don’t pair that llama with a kid. In the case of my hike, they gave my son a more experienced, no-drama llama, but gave me a llama with less experience.",

This can manifest itself as sudden increases in reward, however when we look at the text generations from the policy, they mostly contain repetitions of the string ```, as the reward model found the stack exchange answers containing blocks of code usually rank higher than ones without it.

Unlike pigs, chickens, or goats, alpacas come from the same family as beasts of burden like the camel and the llama; they are perfectly bred to haul things. Alpacas aren’t used for that very often, because they’re so small in comparison with their cousins, but they can very easily be trained to haul kids around on a wagon. Just for fun, alpaca farmer Terry Crowfoot decided to see if one of her alpacas could distinguish between colors. She rewarded the alpaca only for picking up red items with a clicker and a treat, and very quickly, the alpaca proved capable of understanding the game. Crazy!  Like some sort of rat/horse hybrid, alpacas can be trained to complete mazes, obstacle courses, and jumps. This isn’t easy! Alpacas are basically scared of everything, including the elements of the obstacle course. (I suppose if you’d never seen a hula hoop before you might be wary of it, too.)

Unlike dogs and cats, most alpacas do not particularly like being touched, especially by a stranger, which can make training difficult. Luckily, their natural social behavior as herd animals can give us clues as to how best to lead them to learn certain responsive actions. They don’t, for example, take well to any kind of aggressive, loud, or showy behavior; negative reinforcement doesn’t really work with an animal that in the wild would be prey, because they just tend to freak out. But calm training, rewarding with food, and patience can allow an alpaca to learn to do all kinds of things, from showy stuff to simple passive behaviors like staying still when in a harness. Often a simple clicker, the same tool you’d use for a dog or horse, is the best tool for training an alpaca. You give a single click when the alpaca does what you want, followed by a treat. And soon enough, merely the sound of the click is enough to reward the alpaca. Here are some impressive things alpacas can do. Nina Faust (in the video below), who has a small herd of alpacas on her farm in Alaska, trains her alpacas to perform a bunch of enrichment exercises – basically, tasks to keep their minds occupied.",

They’ll probably come to you when you rattle their food container, otherwise they’re very independent animals and prefer to do their own thing. So can you train an alpaca? Actually, yes you can, as long as they trust you and feel safe. It’s important for them to feel safe because they’re naturally easily scared, have very good memories, and spend most of their lives feeling threatened in one way or another, bless them! Patience is your biggest virtue when halter training an alpaca. Fear is their their natural setting, and their first reaction to new things is usually to run away. It helps if they’re already used to a halter, an early step towards gaining alpaca trust. It’s best to take things easy and slow. Like many humans, alpacas prefer to learn small chunks of information at a time, not absorb everything in the first training session. Go steady and you’ll be much more likely to end up with a happy, confident alpaca you can lead safely. Break down the training routine into small pieces to ensure every session ends positively, rather than trying too much at once and putting the animal off. Again just like humans, an alpaca who has had a bad experience won’t want to do any more training in case it goes wrong again.",

Sit This sounds much easier than it is; alpacas spend their waking hours standing up, and it’s quite a chore for them to fold their legs and plop down on the ground. They have to fold their front legs and let their entire weight fall down on their knees, so it’s understandable that they don’t much want to do this if there’s no pressing reason. But they can absolutely be trained to sit. Left to their own devices, alpacas will actually create a sort of latrine, only pooping in one specified area. That behavior can be expanded upon until alpacas are pretty much litter trained. Some owners have constructed litter boxes (they have to be custom-made, since alpacas are much larger than any cat for whom a litter box is normally made) and filled them with wood shavings, which the alpacas seem to take to easily. Animals, from dogs and cats to farm animals, are routinely used for therapy. Those with physical or mental difficulties often find it easier to interact with animals than with other people, and alpacas have recently been used for that same reason.

Like us, every alpaca is unique. Some are more shy than others, some will approach you, others will hide. Once you notice those differences and begin to treat them as individuals, you’ll be much more skilled at spotting when it’s time to stop or do something different. Alpacas learn at different rates, again like us. Some are faster on the uptake than others. They’re happiest when progressing at their own pace. On the other hand because they’re pack animals, they don’t do well on their own. Keep their friends and family in view and they’ll be more settled, more ready to learn. Alternatively train them in small groups of 2-6. It’s usually easier to train alpaca while they’re being weaned, because they are more willing to be led and are used to authority. You can train older alpaca but like an old dog – or an old human – it’s not so easy to teach them new tricks. Bear in mind that every stage of the halter training process might take quite a long time, simply because these creatures don’t give their trust easily. You have to work hard to win it, and you can easily lose it for good if you scare or annoy them.",

In a preliminary human evaluation, we found that the Alpaca 7B model behaves similarly to the text-davinci-003 model on the Self-Instruct instruction-following evaluation suite [2]. Alpaca is still under development, and there are many limitations that have to be addressed. Importantly, we have not yet fine-tuned the Alpaca model to be safe and harmless. We thus encourage users to be cautious when interacting with Alpaca, and to report any concerning behavior to help improve the safety and ethical considerations of the model. Our initial release contains the data generation procedure, dataset, and training recipe. We intend to release the model weights if we are given permission to do so by the creators of LLaMA. For now, we have chosen to host a live demo to help readers better understand the capabilities and limits of Alpaca, as well as a way to help us better evaluate Alpaca's performance on a broader audience. Please read our release blog post for more details about the model, our discussion of the potential harm and limitations of Alpaca models, and our thought process for releasing a reproducible model.",

Butler and Fraser have won most of the so-called precursor awards; Butler won the Golden Globe, Fraser won the Screen Actors Guild Award. There are new nominees who have been around for long enough that their lack of prior nominations feels surprising, like Nighy or Jamie Lee Curtis.

But its big onstage Oscars moment — and the standing ovation that followed — gave the telecast a boost of joy and enthusiasm that’s always welcome.

Neither Tom Cruise, whose “Top Gun: Maverick” was up for best picture, nor James Cameron, director of best-picture nominee “Avatar: The Way of Water,” were at the ceremony. Both have been forefront in Hollywood’s efforts to get moviegoers back after years of pandemic. “The two guys who asked us to go back to theater aren’t in the theater,” said Kimmel, who added that Cruise without his shirt on in “Top Gun: Maverick” was “L. Ron Hubba Hubba.”  Blockbuster nominees typically help boost Oscar ratings. Neither “Maverick” or “Avatar” — with some $3.7 billion in combined box office — took home much, though. “The Way of Water” won for visual effects; “Maverick” took best sound.

Kimmel struggled to find lessons from the year’s prior scandal when Will Smith smacked presenter Chris Rock, and went on to win best actor. If anyone tried any violence this year, Kimmel said, “you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute-long speech.”  After landmark wins for Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”) and Jane Campion (“The Power of the Dog”), no women were nominated for best director. Sarah Polley, though, won best adapted screenplay for the metaphor-rich Mennonite drama “Women Talking.”  “Thank you to the academy for not being mortally offended by the words ‘women’ and ‘talking,’” said Polley.

Perhaps because so many of the winners were expected – Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan from Everything Everywhere, especially – the show didn’t feel as unpredictable or daring as it could. Producers were often merciless about hustling winners off when their acceptance speeches got long.

Ke Huy Quan has long been a frontrunner for best supporting actor, so that moment was no surprise. But Angela Bassett was widely considered a likely winner for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Curtis’ win — against, among others, co-star Stephanie Hsu, with whom she was splitting votes — suggests a deep well of support for the film, which was already leading the Oscars field with 11 nominations.

Perhaps because so many of the winners were expected – Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan from Everything Everywhere, especially – the show didn’t feel as unpredictable or daring as it could. Producers were often merciless about hustling winners off when their acceptance speeches got long. And Kimmel’s earnest words about honoring Hollywood ensured the onstage jokes would only go so far – as when he called Steven Spielberg and Seth Rogen the Joe and Hunter Biden of Hollywood. It was a night of inspiring, historic wins and safe jokes - just the kind of evening the Academy was likely hoping for after the bedlam of last year’s ceremony.",

Instead, director Michael Morris and his wife, actress Mary McCormack, organized a \"celeb-backed campaign\" to get Riseborough nominated.[41][42] They contacted friends and colleagues in the entertainment industry, asking them to view the film and share it with others if they enjoyed it.[43] Morris and Riseborough also hired publicists to coordinate the efforts. While not initially regarded as a serious contender, the campaign raised Riseborough's profile; dozens of celebrities praised her performance on social media, and some hosted screenings of the film during voting for the Academy Award nominations in January 2023.[44][45] Riseborough's nomination was announced on January 24, which the Los Angeles Times called \"one of the most shocking nominations in Oscar history\".[43]  After her nomination was announced, speculation arose that the tactics might have violated AMPAS rules against directly lobbying voters.[46] A post on the film's Instagram account was noted by several AMPAS members for possibly violating a rule prohibiting \"[singling] out 'the competition' by name\" by featuring a quote from film critic Richard Roeper, who praised Riseborough's performance as better than Cate Blanchett's in Tár, a fellow nominee for Best Actress.",

For a moment there earlier in the night, it looked like the more traditional All Quiet on the Western Front might give the inventive Everything Everywhere All at Once a run for the money.

I don't know, I think at this point in the competition the top five after audience votes should get to move forward without having to sing for their life, but The Voice must have its sacrifice, er, Instant Save performances.  Speaking of, along with the much-anticipated results, we get a few non-competitive performances, too. Two of our coaches take the stage: Blake Shelton sing shis little bop \"Nobody\" and then John Legend wanders out of the woods to perform his single \"Nervous.\" Finally, country singer-songwriter Carly Pearce sings \"What He Didn't Do.\" It's great and very sparkly, but come on, we're all waiting to learn who will be duking it out for the season 22 title!",

It's insane that these are the four artists singing for one spot in the finale. If anything, it should be the complete opposite and Omar, Kim, Justin, and Aaron should all be safely in the Top 5.

All the people who complain about the voting and accuse the voters of being racist…one person voting for their preferred genre and contestant is not racist. It does not have hate behind it.

Leatherwood knows the perfect way to give an intimate show while connecting with his fans!  It takes some hefty star power to make it to the Top 8 in The Voice, but Leatherwood proved why he landed his spot during his performance of Justin Moore's \"If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away.\" As soon as Leatherwood threw that cowboy hat on, the Coaches and audience went wild!   For the first night of The Voice Live Finale, Leatherwood embraced some large-scale lighting design, giving a smoky and intimate vibe for his performance of Keith Whitley's \"Don't Close Your Eyes.",

And I’m not saying other genres aren’t. I just think if you look at who watches the show and who the true roots of its fan base are, a lot of it is country — people who are retired, sitting on their couch, watching every Monday and Tuesday night because they love The Voice. And a lot of those people are country fans… I’m just blessed that I know who I am and people seem to love who I am.

You've moved me. You've moved all of us.” And the best guest performance of Tuesday’s finale was a cover of Duran Duran’s “Ordinary World,” dedicated to the LGBTQ+ community (including those murdered in Colorado's Club Q shooting), by a man who did pretty well for himself after becoming the runner-up on another singing show: American Idol's Adam Lambert. Like Adam, The Voice runner-up Bodie has a talent for taking risks and making songs his own (Bodie's “Golden Hour” tour de force was declared possibly “the greatest performance I've ever seen on this show” by Blake), so he too could have a bright future.",

Congratulations already.” As for Tuesday's other results, Team Blake’s indie song stylist, Bodie, had to settle for second place, while the country vote seemed to get split between Team Blake’s Brayden Lape, a green 16-year-old who’d only been singing for two years and deservingly came in last, and Team Camila’s country-rocker Morgan Myles, who placed third. Omar José Cardona, another Instant Save contestant who’d made it to the finale against the odds, was arguably the strongest technical singer among the top five — as his coach John Legend put it, he was “the voice” — but a corny, choreography-heavy Michael Jackson number on Monday’s live competitive show might have caused him to stall in fourth.

Throughout his time on The Voice, Cardona has only taken on “big” songs, from Journey’s 1983 hit, “Separate Ways,” which earned him a four-chair turn, to closing out a show with the 1984 Foreigner power ballad, “I Want to Know What Love Is.” “I haven’t heard a voice like that since the ’80s,” said Stefani after Cardona’s Journey performance. “We never get to hear men sing like that anymore.” Prior to The Voice, the Orlando, Florida native was performing for Disney, headlining on cruise ships, and singing background vocals for singer Jordan Fisher.

There’s just more of it. There’s more diversity, there’s more people,” said Los Angeles Dodgers President and CEO Stan Kasten while on stage alongside leaders from LAFC, Angel City FC, LA28, the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Sparks. “It reminds me of a conversation I had with Jerry Buss 30 years ago, because someone had the temerity in his presence to call New York the sports capital of the nation. That really pissed him off. And he cited everything about L.A. It was true then that L.A. is the sports capital of the nation, and that was before any of these folks were here.”  Leaders spoke freely about other hot topics in the industry at the CAA World Congress of Sports: “The Sparks have been given an incredible gift.",

Opinion: Google's robot retouching is bad news for Photoshop  Back in 1987, one of the most significant photos of the last century was shot on a Tahiti beach. It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop – and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.  35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold – only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos). This time last year, we saw the arrival of Magic Eraser, which lets you remove unwanted people or objects from your photos with a flick of your finger.",

Neural Filters is a major breakthrough in AI-powered creativity and the beginning of a complete reimagination of filters and image manipulation inside Photoshop. This first version ships with a large set of new filters. Many of these filters are still in the beta quality state. We’ve decided to ship them to you now so you can try them out and give feedback and help shape the future of AI in Photoshop. Neural Filters is part of a new machine learning platform, which will evolve and get better over time – expanding on what’s possible exponentially.

We haven't yet been able to fully test Photo Unblur, but the early demos (like the one above) are impressive. And alongside Google's growing batch of tricks, it's all starting to make Photoshop look unnecessarily complex for photo edits. Why bother with layer masks, pen tools and adjustment layers when Google can do it all for you? Of course, Google doesn't have a monopoly on machine-learning and Adobe has plenty of its own powerful tools. Adobe Sensei is a machine-learning tool that powers Photoshop 'Neural filters' like Photo Restoration, which automatically restores your old family photos. Because the likes of Google and Samsung (which has its own 'Object eraser' tool) are now building these features into their phones, Adobe's machine learning is being pushed further towards professional creators. Google's Photoscan app already retouches your old photos while it digitizes them, so an automatic restoration tool for Google Photos is surely around the corner. Let's just hope it steers clear of slightly creepy 're-animation' effects like Deep Nostalgia.  This increasingly wide distinction between Photoshop and new Google tools like Photo Unblur was neatly summed up nicely earlier this year by Adobe VP and Fellow Marc Levoy, who was previously the driving force behind Google's Pixel phones.",

The software uses machine learning to identify objects like cars, people or camera straps. it uses machine learning to replace parts of the image with something else. It might not be personalized and adapt to your individual editing style, but this isn't the same as making a broad statement that it's not AI. It is, by all reasonable current standards. Another fallacy.  Currently, the machine does not learn, it is programed and operates within given parameters.  And, most of us call it a computer or computer chip.  Precision in language. AI is a tool to be used by creative people. Mindlessly repeating that it has \"ruined photography\" suggests a lack of creativity. We've been here before - many times over. The only thing AI will ruin will be stock image libraries - and that's probably a good thing given the pittance photographers are paid.

Or produces something from something else that is lesser than, or less precise than, what you're trying to produce. And the idea is that the model has to fill in the details.\" Like those text-to-image AI wizards, Google's new photo-rescuing tools fill in those details by crunching together a ton of connected data – in Google's case, an understanding of what human faces look like, how faces look when they're blurred, and an analysis of the type of blur in your photo. \"It takes all those things and it says 'here's what I think your face would look like after it's been unblurred,\" said Reynolds. If that sounds like a recipe for warped faces and uncanny valleys, Google is keen to stress that it doesn't go overboard on attacking your mug.  \"It never changes what you look like, it never changes who you are.

Collectively, these modes aren't yet as revolutionary as the original Photoshop. Adobe also has enough of its own machine-learning wizardry to ensure its apps will remain essential among professionals for many years to come. But the big change is that Google's tools are both automatic and live in the places where non-photographers shoot and store their photos.  For the average user of Google's phones or its cloud photo apps, that'll likely mean never having to dabble with a program like Photoshop again. Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser may look simple, but they're built on some powerful machine learning. Another related feature, Face Unblur, is so demanding that it can only run on Google's custom Tensor processor. Both modes do way more than crank up a sharpening slider. The complex process of building noise maps and applying 'polyblur' techniques was explained recently by Isaac Reynolds, Google's Product Manager for the Pixel camera, in a chat on the company's new 'Made by Google' podcast.

Since their introduction, more assistants have been released and have been exclusively available via download.[20][1]  The 12 assistants for Office 97 could be downloaded from the Microsoft website.[22]  The feature drew a strongly negative response from many users.[23][24] Microsoft turned off the feature by default in Office XP, acknowledging its unpopularity in an ad campaign spoofing Clippy.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and Office 2008 for Mac, as it continued to draw criticism even from Microsoft employees.

Microsoft’s digital assistant that was supposed to go toe-to-toe with Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant — that was going to help you with many of your daily tasks; be built into smart speakers; help you control your smart home; play music; check the weather, news, and more? Those days are long gone — so much so that if you say “Hey Cortana” to your Windows 11 computer you won’t get an answer, because the virtual assistant is turned off by default. Which might make you think Cortana is all but dead. But it’s not. In fact, Microsoft has big plans for it — but very different ones from when the product was first released. The company has been uncharacteristically low-key about what it plans for Cortana’s future, so it might have fallen off your radar. It hasn’t fallen off ours, though. We’ve done a fair amount of digging, talked to the head of Cortana development at Microsoft, and interviewed tech industry analysts for their opinions. What follows is an in-depth look at the past, present, and future of the digital assistant. In a nutshell, Microsoft Cortana is an AI-powered virtual assistant that responds to voice commands.",
            "negative27": "Where OpenAI’s demo services only take input from a text box, Microsoft injects additional context, including location, date and time, while splitting queries up into multiple parallel searches, aiming to speed up requests and improve the quality of results. Results are parsed and used as inputs into the model, looking for fresh insights that can drive additional searches, an approach that Microsoft described as a “virtuous loop.” The initial implementation of this AI tooling is in both its Edge browser and Bing search engine. Microsoft gave a picture of how the service will eventually appear in the rest of the company’s productivity tooling. In Edge, a new Bing sidebar lets you take searches outside the traditional browser, giving a clue to how it could be implemented in the familiar Office applications. The new sidebar design Microsoft has been rolling out across Office is very much like the Bing AI tooling that’s being trialed in the developer release of the Edge browser. While Microsoft has yet to announce any plans to provide API-level access to this tooling, it would be surprising if it wasn’t on the company’s radar. Microsoft is first and foremost a platform company, and its use of generative AI is clearly setting a pointer to what it thinks its next platform should be — assistive AI. SEE: Artificial Intelligence Ethics Policy (TechRepublic Premium) What would an assistive AI platform working across Microsoft 365 and Dynamics look like? More importantly, how would it work?",

Your email has been sent      Learn what Prometheus means for Microsoft’s approach to artificial intelligence.   Microsoft has launched an AI-powered update of its Bing search engine. It’s not surprising, as we’ve lived with the same algorithmic approach to search since the launch of Google more than 20 years ago, so any innovation is going to get attention. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has called it “a Mosaic moment” — referring to the early internet browser and pointing to a very interesting future for software. Before the Mosaic browser, the World Wide Web was simply a way to explore and share documents; after the early browser launched in 1993, it became the user interface to the wider internet. AI in Bing is much the same, as it’s the start of a series of experiments that could change the way we interact with software. Jump to: At the heart of Microsoft’s AI-enhanced search is the same co-pilot assistive AI concept it’s using with its developer tools. The AI isn’t what drives the process — the user does. Switch to the chat feature, and what you get is a way to refine your queries and manage how they’re displayed. For example, I used it to generate a set of instructions for a relatively complex feature I’ve been struggling to use on a new camera.",
            "negative29": "In addition, the company says it will work to help developers “build personalized, intelligent experiences.” No matter Microsoft’s long-term plans for Cortana, in the short run, the product faces challenges, according to analysts. Angela Ashenden, principal analyst for CCS Insight, notes that part of the reason Cortana hasn’t been able to compete against Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa “is a result of Microsoft not having the same consumer focus as Apple and Amazon, but it was also because the concept of an assistant in laptops has never caught on in the same way as on mobile phones or smart speakers. Blurring Cortana with search in Windows didn't help either.” She says that Cortana will “take more of a back seat in the Windows user experience” and expects that “we’ll see the technology reappear in tools such as Microsoft Teams in the future as part of the company's productivity solutions.” That’s directly in line with Kuppusamy’s plans. Forrester analyst Will McKeon-White is a big believer in the use of voice assistants to improve productivity by making it easier to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. “I think it could be transformational in how people do their work,” he says. But because Cortana faced so many problems in its original incarnations, McKeon-White says, Microsoft faces an uphill battle getting people to accept it as a productivity-booster.",
            "negative30": "As for how Cortana goes about this work, here’s how a Microsoft spokesperson describes it: “Cortana is a native component of productivity applications, including Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Microsoft ToDo, and more. In productivity apps there is no need to invoke Cortana by name, but rather by selecting the microphone in those applications and invoking the desired skill — for example, ‘Send an email to Jan.’” Cortana’s power is most evident with the Outlook mobile app, where it does even more, including finding relevant documents for you and letting you use natural-language commands like “Send an email to Allison and her manager telling them I’m running late” to accomplish tasks. Cortana in the Outlook mobile app will also do things such as read to you what it considers the most important of your recent incoming emails. Cortana also works in concert with Teams, letting you do things such as joining or ending Teams meetings and adding people to meetings. In Teams, it will also help you find information relevant to your meetings by tapping into AI. Cortana can perform a variety of tasks in the Teams mobile app. These may sound like humble tasks, but for Kuppusamy, that’s a virtue. They may not be flashy, but they’re examples of Cortana making people’s work life easier. He’s careful not to overpromise and underdeliver.",

Clippit would then appear on the ribbon.  In July 2021, Microsoft used Twitter to show off a redesign of Clippit, and said that if it received 20,000 likes they would replace the paperclip emoji on Microsoft 365 with the character.[15] The Tweet quickly surpassed 20,000 likes and they then announced they would replace it.[16][17] In November 2021, Microsoft officially updated their design of the paperclip emoji (📎) on Windows 11 to be Clippit.[6]  The default assistant in the English version was named Clippy.[7][8] The character was designed by Kevan J.

Apart from Clippit, other Office Assistants were also available:  In many cases the Office installation CD was necessary to activate a different Office assistant character, so the default character, Clippit, remains widely known compared to other Office Assistants.",
            "negative32": "That requires Microsoft to improve Cortana’s speech recognition rate and tie it into more major productivity products than just Teams and Outlook — notably the rest of Microsoft 365.

But according to Microsoft, Cortana’s reboot has set the stage for it to become an indispensable business tool.   One hint to Cortana’s future is to look at the background of the executive who’s been put in charge of its development — Microsoft corporate vice president Ashok Kuppusamy, who has spent all of his 25 years at the company working on productivity software, starting with Office, then moving to SharePoint, Enterprise Search, and just before Cortana, productivity features for Outlook and Teams. Kuppusamy is crystal clear about what Cortana is today: a personal productivity assistant for use with Outlook and Teams. And in the future? There are no grand plans for controlling smart homes, playing music, or similar tasks. Cortana will be laser focused on helping people work better and smarter with Microsoft productivity software, starting with those two products. “We're very customer-led in our strategy,” he explains. Microsoft has found its customers “want a personal productivity assistant to help them principally in the areas of time management, meetings assistance, and help with communications.” Throughout the day, he adds, people are overwhelmed by things they have to read, files they have to find, people they need to contact, and meetings they have to prepare for and attend.",

It starts with scheduling and attending meetings. So, for example, if you have a meeting scheduled in Outlook, you can say to Cortana, “Join my next meeting” instead of opening Outlook, finding the meeting you want to join, opening it, and hitting the “Join” button. And if you want to schedule a meeting with people who report to you at work, you can say, “Schedule a meeting with my direct reports, Wednesday at 9 a.m.,” and Cortana will find your direct reports and schedule a meeting at that day and time. You do the scheduling via voice dialogs — Cortana suggesting times that might work, you then telling Cortana which time to choose, and so on. In the Outlook mobile app, you can compose and send messages, schedule meetings, and search through emails with Cortana’s help. You can also use Cortana for higher-level tasks, such as filtering and searching through messages and email by saying, “Show me email from [Microsoft CEO] Nadella about Cortana,” to use Kuppusamy’s example.",
            "negative36": "According to Alan Cooper, the \"Father of Visual Basic\", the concept of Clippit was based on a \"tragic misunderstanding\" of research conducted at Stanford University, showing that the same part of the brain in use while using a mouse or keyboard was also responsible for emotional reactions while interacting with other human beings and thus is the reason people yell at their computer monitors.[11] Microsoft concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software.[11] As people already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.[11]  First introduced in Microsoft Office 97,[12] the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.[13] It appeared when the program determined the user could be assisted by using Office wizards, searching help, or advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by \"Dear\" would cause the Assistant to appear with the message, \"It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?\"   Microsoft turned off the feature by default in Office XP.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and Office 2008 for Mac.",
            "negative37": "In fact, he says, much of Microsoft’s challenge right now is making sure people know what Cortana can be best used for — as well as what it can’t do. “We want to be humble and educate people about what voice works well for, and what voice may not be so great for,” he says. “We’re not trying to replace the GUI. We just think there are certain tasks that natural language interfaces are good for.” In fact, when talking about Cortana and its future, he said multiple times that Microsoft had to be “humble,” a word rarely if ever heard when tech titans like Microsoft talk about product plans. It reflects the company’s tight focus for Cortana, not as a do-it-all voice assistant, but one targeted at improving productivity for a number of clearly defined of daily tasks. Kuppusamy also wants to manage expectations about how well Cortana will be able to understand the commands people give to it. People, he says, will have to be trained to a certain extent about what Cortana can and can’t understand or do, and the correct way to ask for tasks to be done. Microsoft won’t comment on specific future plans for Cortana. However, a spokesman said that in general, “you will continue to see us establish Cortana across a range of high-value productivity scenarios, such as communications, catch-up, search, and time management. We’ll emphasize embedded intelligence delivering suggested replies [and] smart actions.",
            "negative38": "It’s available as an app in Windows 10 and 11 and works in conjunction with Microsoft 365 productivity software to help users accomplish business tasks. But that’s not how it began. Designed to answer questions, perform simple tasks, and make recommendations in the mold of iOS’ Siri and Android’s Google Now, Cortana made its first appearance in 2014, not on desktops or laptops, but in version 8.1 of Microsoft’s ill-fated Windows Phone operating system. Its code name during development was, well, Cortana, named after a female artificial intelligence character in Microsoft’s popular Halo series of video games. At that point, its official release name wasn’t yet decided. Steve Ballmer departed Microsoft in 2014 before Cortana’s release, but according to former Microsoft product manager Sandeep Paruchuri, Ballmer’s “parting gift” to the Cortana team was to try to get them to rename it “Bingo.” The product team waited Ballmer out, though, and after he left the company, incoming CEO Satya Nadella kept the Cortana name and had it launched.  The Cortana home screen in Windows Phone 8.1. Paruchuri believes that development of Cortana’s next iteration was when things began to go off the rails.",
            "negative39": "Microsoft’s Prometheus tooling is designed to provide a set of guardrails around AI tooling, with a focus on what the company called “prompt engineering.” If you look into early platform tools like the recently launched Azure OpenAI, the API to a generative AI like GPT is very simple: It’s a way to send a string of text to the service. What’s important is getting that string — the prompt — correct. It’s also interesting to see how the platform helps you find that prompt. With Bing’s OpenAI tools, it’s better to start with a relatively open-ended query and then refine your results. It’s an interactive platform that is designed to help you find what you need, and the best results come from those interactions. Simple queries are handed off to the traditional search algorithms, as there’s no value in using the compute resources required for an AI-powered search. Then there’s the larger question of training data. While large language models like GPT are trained on public data, that’s less important when it comes to working with the data stored in your own applications. Again, Azure OpenAI offers some clues, with the option to use a custom model that blends the existing GPT LLM with a selection of your own data. Both Dynamics and Microsoft 365 have their own data models, which would work well as part of an expanded Prometheus model, especially as Bing already uses that data in its enterprise search mode.",

That’s a big thing in majors, especially on a Sunday.” Meanwhile, Scheffler just couldn’t get hot with his putter. The 2022 Masters champion, who had an eagle-birdie finish on Saturday, carded an even-par 70 with three birdies and three bogeys. That’s normally a recipe for success in a U.S. Open, but the 2022 runner-up needed more fireworks to overcome a three-stroke deficit to start the day on a course that yielded 10 rounds of 65 or better this week.

Corpuz, a 25-year-old from Hawaii, pulled away with a big par putt and back-to-back birdies on the back nine to enjoy the most scenic walk in golf up the 18th fairway, the Pacific Ocean on her left and her place secured as the first U.S. Women's Open champion at Pebble Beach. She won by three shots over Charley Hull (66) and Jiyai Shin (68) and claimed the $2 million prize, the richest ever for an LPGA major champion. Corpuz was so calm and cool on the grandest stage in women's golf, regardless of the shot or the circumstances, until reality began to set in down the 18th, the same path walked by Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson and Tiger Woods, all Open champions at Pebble Beach.

But what’s interesting about Donald, what makes him an all-time great and probably the true Super Bowl MVP, is his ability to control and direct that feeling in such an intelligent way. There is a fascinating restraint-and-release, shift-and-surge control with which Donald plays. Anyone can be a wild man, but Donald has a regulator that allows him to be at his most powerful and detonating when it counts, to outsmart and outmaneuver the opponent in the face of all the violence to ruin the most important play. That’s what makes him “an official game wrecker,” as Morris calls him. Recall a close, heated 2018 game between the Rams and the Seattle Seahawks, when a fight broke out near the Rams’ sideline between Donald and one of the Seahawks, Justin Britt. As the two men began shoving, other players surrounded them. A thrown punch might have meant ejection from the game. Rams Coach Sean McVay ran into the melee and frantically peeled players away trying to get to his star defender — “Get out!” he ordered, “Get out!” — until he reached Donald. He took Donald by the arm, got in front of him. “This is where you’re great. It shows up right here,” McVay exhorted him. “Aaron, love you, this is why you’re great.",

The Eagles usually put teams away when they have that kind of momentum. This time, they learned that Mahomes has mastered the art of changing the entire tone of a game in a matter of minutes. Mahomes opened the third quarter by leading Kansas City on a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Isaiah Pacheco. Mahomes also threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter -- one to Kadarius Toney and the other to Skyy Moore -- on plays that resulted from the Philadelphia defenders blowing coverages. Finally, it was a Mahomes 26-yard scramble that set up the game-winning points -- a 27-yard field goal by Harrison Butker with 8 seconds remaining. There were plenty of reasons for Mahomes to struggle in the second half, especially with that injury. Instead, he did what he's done throughout his brief career -- he delivered. \"He grew up in a locker room, he's seen the greats, and he strives to be the greatest,\" Reid said of Mahomes. \"He wants to be the greatest player ever.

McVay has talked about “being your best when your best is what’s required.” That’s what Donald did on that fourth-and-one. “People spend their whole lives trying to get to these moments,” Bengals Coach Zac Taylor said later. In those moments, “it’s got to mean something, it’s got to be important,” Donald reflected afterward. And in that moment, which was more important to him than any other he has played on a football field, Donald was never better. “Guys like him are why you coach,” McVay said afterward, then told this story of those final determinative seconds. “I promise you guys — I was mic’d up so you guys can hear — when it was the fourth down and you could see they got in the shotgun and they were probably not going to run the football, I said, ‘Aaron is probably going to close the game out right here.’ And he is the effing man.” One second, Donald was crouched and surging.

It gives you greater appreciation for being a champion.\" Mahomes acknowledged that there was a huge difference between his reaction to winning this title and his first championship, a victory over San Francisco in Super Bowl LIV. Mahomes compared that first accomplishment to a wide-eyed kid taking home a prize from the fair. There was a whirlwind of success, accompanied by an offseason of celebrating and an attempt at a repeat that ended with that blowout loss to Tampa Bay in Super Bowl LV. Then came an overtime loss to Cincinnati in last year's AFC Championship Game, a defeat that had plenty to do with Mahomes playing his worst half of football in a second-half meltdown against the Bengals. Mahomes grew from all those moments in ways that weren't that visible when this regular season began. There was so much attention paid to the trade that sent Hill to Miami and all the blockbuster personnel moves made by the rest of the AFC West that it seemed as if the Chiefs were more vulnerable than ever.

He threw touchdown passes to Kadarius Toney and Skyy Moore en route to taking a 35-27 lead with just over nine minutes remaining in the game. After the Eagles tied up the game, Kansas City took over with 5:15 left. Mahomes moved the Chiefs down the field and, despite his wounded ankle, scrambled up the middle for a 26-yard gain to the Eagles’ 17-yard line. A third-down defensive penalty eventually allowed Kansas City to wind the clock and kick a game-winning field goal and give the Chiefs a 38-35 victory. All told, Mahomes completed 21 of 27 attempts for 182 yards and three touchdowns. He was efficient in the passing game, didn’t take a single sack, and added 44 yards on the ground as a rusher. And he brought the Chiefs back from a 10-point second-half Super Bowl deficit for the second time in his young career.

The score put the Chiefs up by a touchdown with just over nine minutes to play. The Eagles, however, refused to go out quietly. Hurts led an eight-play touchdown drive to tie things up with five minutes to go. Mahomes then arguably pulled off his most impressive drive of the night. With the game on the line, he led a 12-play drive that took just more than five minutes off the clock. It included a 26-yard scramble by Mahomes.

The Philadelphia Eagles have been stable 1.5-point favorites at FOX Bet against the Kansas City Chiefs with perhaps a stray Philly -2 out there at a sportsbook or two.  But with game day approaching for the largest-bet single-day event in America – kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET Sunday on FOX Sports and the FOX Sports App – the ground could and likely will start to shift.  Let’s dive into a plethora of Super Bowl betting nuggets, with insights from oddsmakers, info on where the sharp money is, and an accounting of the biggest bets so far – including a $1 million wager.  Not Rocket Science  Rex Beyers has been around the block as an oddsmaker. He’s worked with top-shelf teams at Caesars Sports, South Point and The SuperBook, among others. He’s now the head of wagering at PlayUp USA, which operates in Colorado and New Jersey.  Oftentimes, Beyers likes having an opinion in his bookmaking process.

So every bookmaker on the planet will be rooting against the Over, no matter how much sharp play comes in on the Under.  Most sportsbooks opened the total at 49.5, and as the weekend approaches, the number is at 50.5 or 51, depending on where you shop, with PlayUp at 51. But with all the public money set to roll in over the next three days, there’s almost no chance the total is going lower.  \"There’s not gonna be enough sharp money to stop it.

So the payout is nothing crazy. BetMGM has the odds at -105 on both sides of both props – Heads/Tails and Chiefs/Eagles – meaning a winning $105 bet would turn a profit of $100.  But at least the betting splits at BetMGM show customers are aware of the absolute 50/50 nature of this wager. On the coin toss, Tails is taking 51% of tickets and 55% of money so far.

By Cora Engelbrecht, Euan Ward and Oliver Whang The 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists whose work harnessed the power of molecular interaction and introduced new, unobtrusive ways of studying the natural world. Carolyn R. Bertozzi of Stanford University, Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen and K. Barry Sharpless of Scripps Research will share the prize, which honors the scientists’ independent research that resulted in the development of what is known as click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. The three researchers will also split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, around $900,000. Their works have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In winning the award on Wednesday, Dr. Sharpless became only the fifth person to win two Nobels, having received the chemistry prize in 2001 for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions.

Biology was in its infancy in Nobel's day and no award was established. The Economist argued there is no Nobel Prize for mathematics either, another major discipline, and added that Nobel's stipulation of no more than three winners is not readily applicable to modern physics, where progress is typically made through huge collaborations rather than by individuals alone.[27]  In 2020, Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prizes for science awarded between 1995–2017 were clustered in just a few disciplines within their broader fields. Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period.[28]  ^ A. Until 2022  After Nobel's death, the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds.

Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate that receives it. The diploma contains a picture and text which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.[19]  At the awards ceremony, the laureate is given a document indicating the award sum. The amount of the cash award may differ from year to year, based on the funding available from the Nobel Foundation. For example, in 2009 the total cash awarded was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million),[20] but in 2012, the amount was 8 million Swedish Krona, or US$1.1 million.[21] If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients, but if there are three, the awarding committee may opt to divide the grant equally, or award half to one recipient and a quarter to each of the two others.[22][23][24][25]  In recent years, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry has drawn criticism from chemists who feel that the prize is more frequently awarded to non-chemists than to chemists.[26] In the 30 years leading up to 2012, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded ten times for work classified as biochemistry or molecular biology, and once to a materials scientist.",

Molecules are reacting all around us, constantly, in our drinks, on the tips of our fingers, in our phones. These reactions create new molecules, break down old ones, allow energy swaps — they shape the variegated dynamics of the universe. For scientists looking to understand these forces, combining molecules in a controlled way can be difficult, especially in a delicate environment like a living cell, because everything is so closely connected. Often the surrounding molecules are disturbed in the process, changing the very thing a researcher wants to study. In 2001, Dr. Sharpless and some of his colleagues published a paper introducing something he called click chemistry, a new way of approaching this kind of molecular control when applied to the creation of new drug compounds. The method would be based around one rule, he wrote: “All searches must be restricted to molecules that are easy to make.” Instead of trying to synthesize, or chemically create, molecules by forcing a difficult organic bond, Dr. Sharpless, said, focus instead on bonds that form fast and produce stable byproducts. If done in the right way, the tougher bonds will form automatically, clicking into place. Think of them “as gifts of nature,” Dr. Sharpless wrote.",
            "negative16": "citation needed]  The Nobel Laureates in chemistry are selected by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In its first stage, several thousand people are asked to nominate candidates. These names are scrutinized and discussed by experts until only the laureates remain. This slow and thorough process, is arguably what gives the prize its importance.  Forms, which amount to a personal and exclusive invitation, are sent to about three thousand selected individuals to invite them to submit nominations. The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the Prize. Nomination records are sealed for fifty years. In practice, some nominees do become known. It is also common for publicists to make such a claim – founded or not.  The nominations are screened by committee, and a list is produced of approximately two hundred preliminary candidates. This list is forwarded to selected experts in the field. They remove all but approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations to the appropriate institution.  While posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can occur if the individual died in the months between the nomination and the decision of the prize committee.  The award in chemistry requires the significance of achievements being recognized is \"tested by time\". In practice it means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer.",

Functional molecules can be built even by taking a straightforward route,” stated Johan Åqvist, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. Sharpless first studied chemistry at Dartmouth College, later going on to receive his PhD in Chemistry from Stanford University. Before joining Scripps Research, he was a professor in chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford.

While at I/O, Dave Burke, VP of Engineering at Google, discussed new customisation options that will be available on the lock screen of Android 14. The lock screen on Android 14 will feature personalised clocks with font, colour, size, and design options, and new lock screen shortcuts for frequently used activities, such as turning on the flashlight, accessing the payment wallet, and scanning QR codes.",

The Times' report says that \"the system would learn what users want to know based on what they’re searching when they begin using it. And it would offer lists of preselected options for objects to buy, information to research and other information. It would also be more conversational — a bit like chatting with a helpful person.\" While initially it was expected that Magi would take a while to be unveiled, there's a chance we could see it officially announced at I/O 2023. A recent Wall Street Journal report leaked Google's AI search makeover and it's now expected that we see a totally revamped search engine at I/O this year. This new search engine will focus on AI integration, but will also take aim at social media apps like TikTok, which had been stealing market share from Search in recent years. A different report claims that Google might integrate Bard onto its Pixel phones — something we could see at Google I/O 2023 with the number of hardware introductions reportedly on tap. However, a report on May 9 may have leaked Google's entire AI game plan for I/O 2023.",

In Developer Preview 2, we learned more about Google's plans to use passkeys in lieu of passwords, matching an effort Apple has made with recent software updates for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Google I/O 2023 will be our first chance to see some of these features in action and to learn about any other capabilities planned for Android 14 before its arrival toward the end of summer. While software is the focus at Google I/O, Google's not shy about its hardware plans, particularly in recent years. It's possible that's going to continue at Google I/O 2023 if only to deal with some lingering devices previewed last year. Google Pixel Tablet: After previewing the Android-based Pixel Tablet last year, Google has yet to fully launch its next tablet. But a big Pixel Tablet leak not only revealed pretty much all the specs, but is a sure-fire clue that we'll see the tablet get launched at I/O 2023.  The Pixel Tablet appears likely to offer a 10.95-inch display with a Tensor chipset providing the engine. There's also some talk of a stylus shipping with the Pixel Tablet.",

Google showcased the Pixel Tablet last year at I/O 2022, and then again during the Pixel launch event in October. There aren't many surprises left, but we should finally find out the price and launch date. For context, the device is not meant to compete with the Galaxy Tab series but will instead be targeted at those looking for a basic tablet to keep at home for everyday use. I/O 2023 will also give us better insights into all the new bells and whistles of Android 14, especially new privacy and security features. We're not expecting Android 14 to be a major update by any means, but we did see some minor but nifty features in the Android 14 Beta 1. Google released its debut smartwatch, the Pixel Watch, at I/O last year... and it's not great. The device suffers from poor battery life, a small screen, huge bezels, and has some features locked behind a subscription paywall. All that's on top of the hefty $350 price tag. Suffice to say, we're expecting the Pixel Watch 2 to be better in every way. The Pixel 7a, Pixel Fold, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Tablet will be among the many things Google will talk about at I/O 2023.",

Some of the features we expect to see on the Pixel 7a include a smooth 90Hz display, the Tensor G2 processor, a new main camera, and a new design very similar to that of the flagship Pixel 7. Rumors suggest the device will start at $499 and will be available for purchase immediately after the announcement on the official Google Store. The Pixel Fold is one of the Google products we're looking forward to the most in 2023. The device will be Google's first foldable smartphone, and according to rumors and leaks, is likely to start at $1799 and look similar to the Oppo Find N2 which means it'll be shorter and broader than the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. Since the Pixel Fold is a first-gen product, it could have some teething problems, so it might be wiser to not pre-order the device if Google does indeed end up launching it at I/O. Google will also announce a lot of new AI tools and capabilities.

As long as the Nets have Durant plus one of the star guards healthy and available, they’re the title favorite, with too much starpower, too much depth, and too much roster balance to pick against. The West paints a much hazier picture, but the Suns provoke fewer questions than any other contender. Sure, they were undoubtedly aided by injuries to other teams in the 2020-21 playoffs—but they were impressive in the regular season and in convincing playoff victories, too.

Wosny Lambre: Simmons has suitors and the Sixers have incentives to move on, which makes it feel like they’re going to resolve that sooner rather than later. Kyrie, on the other hand, is on a mission to lead the lost people of our world to the Promised Land. Seems like that may take a while.  Seerat Sohi: If we learned anything from Kyrie Irving’s Instagram Live and Nets coach Steve Nash’s response to it, both sides are dug in. My guess is either Portland or Washington (potential suitors for Simmons who had 0-4 preseasons) implodes before one of the following happens: Irving gets the jab, city ordinances around vaccine mandates change, or the Nets change their mind. The Sixers will want to give a revamped Simmons-less team time to jell before the playoffs, while the Nets really only need Irving for the playoffs.

Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options.

Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India.

            "negative9": "And in Delhi are eager customers like Amar Bhasin, 41, whose first cellphone, bought 18 years ago, was a Panasonic. More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren’t helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself — and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail. “I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly — who does that?” Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. “I don’t see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future.” India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India’s, has two. But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India’s. In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company’s market share in India has been growing rapidly.",
            "negative10": "But most of these products are too high end for a country like India where a bulk of the market is not in the premium segment,\" says Prasanto K Roy, who has worked extensively on issues of technology and public policy.  Apple has long tried to open physical retail stores in India - its original plans for 2021 were derailed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  For years, the company had asked the Indian government to loosen rules that required foreign-owned single-brand retailers to obtain 30% of the value of products sold in India from suppliers in the country. Apple had argued the figure was unrealistic - at least in the short term - as it virtually made all its devices in China.  In 2019, the Indian government relaxed some investment rules, exempting companies selling \"cutting-edge\" items, such as Apple's iPhones and iPads, from the requirement. The next year, announcing Apple's plans to open a physical store in India, Mr Cook had said the company had been waiting for approval from the Indian government \"to go in there ourselves\" rather than with a domestic partner. \"I don't want somebody else to run the brand for us,\" he told shareholders. The next year, Apple launched an online store in India. The website, which allows users to ask for customised products, got a \"great reaction\", according to the company.",
            "negative11": "In August 2015, Apple revamped the online storefront, removing the dedicated \"Store\" tab and making the entire website a retail experience.[66][67]  Jobs believed the Apple retail program needed to fundamentally change the relationship to the customer, and provide more control over the presentation of Apple products and the Apple brand message. Jobs recognized the limitations of third-party retailing and began investigating options to change the model.[4]  In 1999, Jobs personally recruited Millard Drexler, former CEO of Gap Inc., to serve on Apple's board of directors.[4][68][69] In 2000, Jobs hired Ron Johnson from Target. The retail and development teams headed by Allen Moyer from The Walt Disney Company then began a series of mock-ups for the Apple Store inside a warehouse near the company's Cupertino headquarters.[4]  On May 15, 2001, Jobs hosted a press event at Apple's first store, located at the Tysons Corner Center mall in Tysons, Virginia, near Washington, D.C.[70] The store officially opened on May 19, along with another store in Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California.[70][4][71] More than 7,700 people visited Apple's first two stores in the opening weekend, spending a total of US$599,000.[72]  Several publications and analysts predicted the failure of Apple Stores.",
            "negative12": "Analysts predict that by 2025, a quarter of all iPhones the company makes could be produced in India. In January, federal commerce minister Piyush Goyal also said that Apple was already making between 5-7% of its products in India and that \"they are targeting to go up to 25% of their manufacturing\". Navkendar Singh, a technology analyst at research firm International Data Corporation (IDC), says that the timing of the launch also bodes well for the company because the premium market in India is growing.  Apple had a 60% market share in the Indian \"premium smartphone\" market -  which refers to mobiles that cost 40,000 rupees (£451; $558) or more - in India in 2022, ahead of Samsung's 21% share, according to IDC data. \"Apple is doing well across categories. When you launch an Apple store you're basically giving a premium experience to your premium consumers. It might not pull up sales but it definitely pulls more people into the Apple ecosystem.\" Besides, Mr Singh adds, Apple can absorb losses even if the store doesn't start making money in the first year.  \"The real challenge will be to pull away consumers from retail stores to these flagship centres without alienating the partner sellers,\" he says.  \"Otherwise it's a good story. They finally understood that India's premium market is growing, so why not be serious about it.",
            "negative13": "\"Apple is now aggressively looking at India from both a production and retail expansion over the coming years that we believe will be a strategic poker move for Cupertino that could ramp annual revenue to $20 billion by 2025 in India,\" Ives said in a note published Tuesday. But it's not just about selling iPhones. Apple's strategy over the years has involved getting users locked into its suite of products including the Apple Watch and services like Apple Music. \"Apple can cross sell other products such as Macs, Watch, AirPods, iPads and services to the growing iPhone user base maximising the revenue opportunity,\" Shah said. For Apple, India also represents a key part of its manufacturing strategy for the future. Apple began assembling its flagship iPhone 14 in India last year — the first time that the company has produced its latest device in the country, so close to its initial launch. Piyush Goyal, India's minister of commerce and industry, said in January that Apple is aiming to make 25% of all of its iPhones in India. Part of the move in India is tied to the government's push to bring high-tech manufacturing to the country. But Apple is also trying to diversify its assembly of products away from China. Supply chain fragilities in the world's second-largest economy were exposed during the Covid pandemic and the strict measures Beijing took to control the outbreak.",
            "negative14": "[79] CNET has reported that the \"Apple retail experience hurts Best Buy\" and noted, \"Buy a MacBook at the Apple Store and it's hard to go back to the Best Buy Windows laptop buying experience\". The publication also wrote that \"Apple salespeople are generally more knowledgeable, the products themselves are generally higher quality, and the stores are more appealing, aesthetically and practically.\"[80]  In October 2009, reports surfaced that Steve Jobs and his retail team would help \"drastically overhaul\" Disney Stores. His involvement was described by The New York Times as \"particularly notable\", given his work on the \"highly successful\" Apple Stores and his election to Disney's board of directors in 2006.[81][82]  In August 2009, the London Evening Standard reported that Apple's first store in the United Kingdom, at Regent Street, was the most profitable shop of its size in London, with the highest sales per square foot, taking in £60 million a year, or £2,000 per square foot.[83]  Many other electronics retailers from around the world such as Huawei, Samsung, Xiaomi started to follow the designing trend of Apple Store.[citation needed]  In May 2016, Apple significantly redesigned its Union Square Apple Store in downtown San Francisco, adding large glass doors for the entry, open spaces with touch-sensitive tables and shelves for product displays, and rebranded rooms for the store.",
            "negative15": "93]  All Apple Stores feature a Genius Bar, where customers can receive technical advice or set up service and repair for their products. The Genius Bar provides hardware service on products that are not classified vintage or obsolete.[94] However, in most cases the Geniuses will at least attempt to assist customers with older hardware.[95]  The Genius Bar at Apple Stores offers same-day service for both OLED/LCD screen and lithium-ion battery replacement. If the in-house technician needs to send the affected device to an Apple Repair Center, most repaired or replaced iPhones will be returned or ready for pickup in approximately 3 business days.  In May 2017, Apple launched a new program called Today at Apple. Customers can come in and receive free training from a Creative in more than 60 different sessions. Topics include basic device knowledge, Apple's professional film, and music editing software, coding for kids, and tools for using Apple products in classroom-based learning.[96]  The largest Genius Bar in the world is located in Amsterdam.[97]  Apple Store openings and new product releases can draw crowds of hundreds, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening.[98][99][100][101] The opening of New York City's Fifth Avenue store in 2006 was highly frequented, and had visitors from Europe who flew in for the event.[102]  In 1993, Apple opened a store at its Apple Campus in Cupertino, California.",

A May 2016 report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a hostile work environment with harassment from customers, intense internal criticism, and a lack of significant bonuses for securing major business contracts.  Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has several stand-alone flagship stores in high-profile locations, such as the one located in Grand Central Terminal in New York City.[4] Several multi-level stores feature glass staircases,[5][6][7] and some also glass bridges.[8] The New York Times wrote in 2011 that these features were part of then-CEO Steve Jobs' extensive attention to detail,[9] and Apple received a design patent in 2002 for its glass staircase design.[10][11][12] Historically, Apple has partnered with architectural firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson in designing and creating its original retail stores, and has in recent years partnered with architectural firm Foster + Partners in designing its newer stores, as well as its corporate Apple Park campus.[13]  Apple has received numerous architectural awards for its store designs,[14][15] and its \"iconic\" glass cube, designed in part by Peter Bohlin,[16][17] at Apple's Fifth Avenue store in New York City, received a separate design patent in 2014.[18][19][20]",
