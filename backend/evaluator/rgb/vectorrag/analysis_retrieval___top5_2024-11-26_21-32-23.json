Maybe Roglič (correctly) bet the race would come back together and it wasn’t a wise use of strength. But after he seemed slightly less fit on climbs than Vingegaard at June’s Criterium du Dauphiné, the fact that he wasn’t present at a crucial moment will do little to settle the debate about which rider is the team’s best shot at yellow. Elsewhere, Ineos was clearly the most watchful of the GC teams, with Yates, Geraint Thomas, and Dani Martinez attentive at the front. There’s a lot of race left in the Tour but we may look back on today’s events as a predictor of what was to come. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) remained the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing second on Stage 3 in Sønderborg. The 27-year-old actually extended his lead by earning a 6-second time bonus on the finish line. The Netherland’s Dylan Groenewegen (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) won the stage, his first Tour stage win since 2019."

The next three stages suit the Belgian’s talents, so there’s a good chance that he’ll hold the Tour’s yellow jersey for a few more days. Who’s really winning the Tour? A relatively peaceful stage was interrupted by a large crash with about 10km to-go, emphasizing how important it is to stay as close to the front as possible at the end of these early stages.  Luckily, most of the Tour’s GC contenders managed to avoid losing time, with the exception of Colombia’s Rigoberto Uran (EF Education-EasyPost), who was held up by a crash for the second day in row and this time was unable to rejoin the leaders. The 35-year-old lost 39 seconds by the finish, a tough blow to his chances of scoring a high finish in Paris. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) is the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France."

His fellow doctors, their patients, and the never-ending politics surrounding New Amsterdam hospital have made for entertaining viewing. New Amsterdam will come to an end with its fifth season after running successfully since 2018. It became a mainstay on NBC, airing on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. After gaining favorable reviews, it earned a three-season renewal only halfway through its second season. And while there was excitement at the news that the series was renewed, fans of the show will have to deal with the bitter-sweet reality of their favorite show coming to an end in Season 5. It has had a good run, but every good run has an end, and New Amsterdam's end is nigh. How will Max cope without Dr. Helen Sharpe in his life? How will he heal from the heartbreak after Helen failed to show up for their rooftop wedding? Season 5 will seek to answer these questions New Amsterdam was created by David Schulner and directed by Peter Horton."

A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second television series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season."

Mr Chew will certainly be feeling it, after a torrid time giving evidence. Many tech execs have stood before Congress, and they often don't get an easy ride.  But what was exceptional about this hearing was the stubborn, never-ending line of vicious questioning.  From both Democrats and Republicans, there was no let-up. A spokesperson for TikTok said afterwards the politicians were \"grandstanding\". There is most certainly some truth to that. But between the sometimes frustratingly verbose questioning, we did learn a thing or two.  There was criticism of TikTok from Republicans and Democrats, and the level of distrust and scepticism from all sides was stark.  \"Welcome to the most bipartisan committee in Congress,\" said Republican congressman Buddy Carter.  This video can not be played Committee chair to TikTok CEO: 'We aren't buying it' \"Thank you, Mr Chew, for bringing Republicans and Democrats together,\" said Dan Crenshaw, a Republican.  It was really quite something to see so many politicians - who agree on practically nothing - agreeing wholeheartedly that TikTok was a security threat."

The products are so similar that it comes down to user preference on which they choose. Read the full iPhone 14 Plus Review from AppleInsider and see why we gave it a 4 out of 5. The 2022 iPhone production cycle went through a dramatic upheaval thanks to China's zero covid policy. Employees at a Zhengzhou Foxconn plant rioted after poor conditions during lockdown. Production lines were subsequently shut down as employees left the company and hiring slowly filled the holes. It took until January 2023 before production stabalized and iPhone 14 Pro saw regular ship times. Estimations place the impact on Apple's December quarter at about 13 million fewer iPhone units shipped year over year. This is an estimated 15% impact on revenue, which showed in the December quarter earnings. The rumor cycle for iPhone 14 started early. Just days before Apple announced the iPhone 13 lineup, Jon Prosser shared an image of the 2022 iPhone. However, this image was a far cry from what was ultimately announced. There were just too many technological advancements that would be needed for it to be possible. The alleged design showed that the camera bump was gone, a single camera cutout had replaced the notch, and the sides resembled an iPhone 4. After this render made the rounds for a few weeks, more realistic rumors appeared."

Below, she is seen on a boat in a green-and-turquoise look and matching hat, channeling the monarch's signature style.  Production for the fifth season will kick off in July, Variety confirmed with The Crown's producers. Filming will take place at the usual Elstree Studios, just north of London, and is expected to abide by strict COVID-19 protocols, even as lockdown measures in the United Kingdom begin to ease up.  With production beginning this summer, Season 5 likely won't arrive to Netflix until 2022, Deadline previously reported. The delay wasn't caused by the coronavirus pandemic, however. Apparently, the break was planned all along.  After Season 4 debuted last fall, fans will have to wait more than a year for the next installment. Of course, this isn't the first time The Crown has taken a long break; there was a two-year wait between Seasons 2 and 3 too.   Although Netflix announced in January 2020 that The Crown's fifth season would be its last, months later, the streamer confirmed that the series would in fact get one more chapter."

But in late January 2020, Deadline reported that the show’s fifth season would be its last.  “At the outset I had imagined The Crown running for six seasons, but now that we have begun work on the stories for season 5 it has become clear to me that this is the perfect time and place to stop,” Morgan said in a statement. “I’m grateful to Netflix and Sony for supporting me in this decision.” This decision was again reversed in July 2020. Morgan confirmed, via Deadline, that the show would return for a sixth season. “As we started to discuss the storylines for Series 5, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons,” Morgan stated. “To be clear, Series 6 will not bring us any closer to present-day—it will simply enable us to cover the same period in greater detail.”  This means The Crown will skip over some major content opportunities for the show. In early 2020, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle sent ripples through the monarchy when they announced they would step down from their senior royal roles."

By Radhika Seth and Kerry McDermott The next installment of Netflix’s big-budget, awards-laden original series is expected to cover the early to mid-1990s, a period in which the marriage of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, was rapidly disintegrating. Yes. On October 20, Netflix released the first official trailer for The Crown Season 5—and it’s a scorcher. It opens with a shot of Windsor Castle in flames (a fire ravaged the royal residence during the Queen’s annus horribilis in 1992) and then shows Imelda Staunton as the monarch, examining its ashen remains. “In light of the events of the last 12 months, perhaps I have more to reflect on than most,” she muses in voiceover. Also featured? Elizabeth Debicki’s Princess Diana and Dominic West’s Prince Charles looking stony-faced during a meeting with the Queen; the latter confronting her son about his ongoing affair with Olivia Williams’s Camilla Parker Bowles; Diana seemingly reaching breaking point and taking off her famous sapphire and diamond engagement ring; and later donning her famous “revenge dress."

We previously took a look at the technical readout of the iPhone 14 Pro, offering us a chance to look at the camera hardware changes. Our key takeaway was that there are indeed some major changes, even if just on paper. The rear camera bump is almost all-new: the iPhone 14 Pro gains larger sensors in its ultra-wide and main (wide) cameras, but Apple also promises leaps in image quality through improved software processing and special silicon. However, what caught everyone’s eye first was the opener of Apple’s presentation of iPhone 14 Pro: a striking visual change. The iPhone’s recognizable screen cutout or ‘notch’ had all but disappeared, tucking its camera and sensor hardware into a small yet dynamic ‘island’. The user interface adapts around it; growing and shrinking with the screen cutout in an absolute feat of design. What’s more impressive to us, however, was miniaturizing the complex and large array of sensors and camera needed for Face ID. While the large cameras protruding ever-further from the rear of our iPhones capture our attention first — and will certainly get the most attention in this review, as well — the front-facing camera in the iPhone 14 Pro saw one of the biggest upgrades in recent memory, with its sensor, lens and software processing seeing a significant overhaul."

                "node_text": "When you try to take a photo with the main camera and are standing very close to a subject, the iPhone 14 Pro switches to the ultrawide camera and crops the framing to mimic the main camera. This allows for a closer focus, which is great for close-up shots of small things.  Macro mode lets you get within inches of your subject and keep it in focus, like this Lego car. Last year's 13 Pro had a similar feature, but with the new ultrawide, macro photos have better image quality, especially in medium and low light. Another macro photo from the 14 Pro. The 14 Pro nails the focus on Lego Batman in this macro photo. The telephoto camera is basically identical to the one on last year's 13 Pro, but it gets a lift from the 14 Pro's Photonic Engine. Under good lighting, like in the picture below, the telephoto camera takes good photos. Notice in particular the colors and how the camera handles skin tones. A telephoto shot of folks noshing in a parklet. As with the ultrawide, image quality is a step behind the main camera -- especially in dimmer environments. I took this photo of the Embarcadero's Ferry Building during blue hour, with the 14 Pro's telephoto camera. Below is a Portrait mode picture of Maisie the cat taken indoors with the telephoto camera."

The company laid off 11,000 workers in November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta is now worth less than $300 billion. Other Company of the Year setbacks? Square (SQ), our 2018 winner, began to focus on cryptocurrency a couple years later, eventually changing its name to Block—as in blockchain.

Some details, like unique Fitbit integration and a minimalist design, knocked it out of the park. Others, like disappointing battery life, rang up short. Now just months later, we’re already looking ahead to the next season of potentially exciting wearable launches. Most importantly, we’re eager to see Google drop a second generation of its very first smartwatch to see if it can polish up the rough edges. Stay tuned to hear everything we know about the Google Pixel Watch 2 and find out what features we are most hopeful to see for the search giant’s next attempt. Ever since the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 series, the Wear OS landscape has been an exciting market to watch. Samsung kept its foot on the gas with the Galaxy Watch 5, and other companies, such as Fossil, have scrambled to keep up. When the first Pixel Watch finally landed in the fray, we accepted Google’s smartwatch as an imperfect but promising first attempt."

The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual/augmented reality headset with similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.   Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands.  The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.   At the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio. The audio straps connect to a 3D braided fabric strap that secures the headset to the back of the head, with an adjustable dial for tightening it up for a customizable fit."

Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown."

On 19 May, the museum confirmed in a statement that the gala had been cancelled “due to the global health crisis”. Andrew Bolton, curator of the Costume Institute, found inspiration for the Met Gala 2020 theme and exhibition in the 1992 Sally Potter film Orlando, which was based on Virginia Woolf’s novel of the same name. “There’s a wonderful scene,” he said, “in which Tilda Swinton enters the maze in an 18th century woman’s robe à la Francaise, and as she runs through it her clothes change to mid-19th century dress, and she re-emerges in 1850s England. That’s where the original idea came from.” By Héloïse Salessy By Emma Spedding By Jessica Scemama Naomi Osaka wore Louis Vuitton for the 2021 Met Gala.  The Met Gala was originally scheduled to take place on the first Monday in May, which would have fallen on 4 May 2020."

Animated programs have the option to compete in broader program categories such as Outstanding Comedy Series, but cannot also submit for Outstanding Animation Program in the same year.[citation needed] The Simpsons, for instance, unsuccessfully submitted the episodes \"A Streetcar Named Marge\" and \"Mr. Plow\" in 1993 and 1994[1] while Family Guy was successfully nominated in 2009.[2] Several animated programs won Outstanding Children's Program prior to 1979 and, in the years since, Rugrats, Winnie the Pooh specials and Star Wars Rebels have been nominated for that award.  Prior to 1989, all of the nominated programs were specials produced outside the confines of a running series. The category was divided into programs \"one hour or less\" and \"more than one hour\" from 1989 to 2009, with episodes of running series becoming eligible. Programs that are 15 minutes or less were given their own category, Outstanding Short Form Animated Program, in 2008.[citation needed]"

Friday’s transaction puts STX in a position to further develop, market and distribute content globally through multiple distribution channels including theatrical releases, international and direct-to-streaming services, as well as video-on-demand. STX is pivoting away from what originally was conceived as 12 theatrical releases annually. The studio now is planning 15 films a year, with five destined for the big screen and the balance split between straight-to-streaming or international theatrically distributed PVOD or direct-to-streaming titles. Like other studios, STX pivoted during the pandemic, with either hybrid theatrical releases or licensing lucratively straight to streaming. STX sent Greenland to PVOD stateside, skipped theatrical (when New York and Los Angeles cinemas were closed) and sold streaming to HBO Max on that Gerard Butler movie in summer 2020. It licensed what was to be a theatrical release, My Spy, to Amazon. It did handle The Mauritanian, which won a Golden Globe.

He served as a Bishop and missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Orrin G. Hatch was born on March 22, 1934, in Homestead Park, Pennsylvania—just outside of Pittsburgh. His mother was a homemaker and his father was a union carpenter and plaster lather. In humble circumstances, they raised nine children in the aftermath of the Great Depression.  Hatch’s childhood, though happy, was also marked by poverty and significant hardship. When Hatch was just ten years old, he was deeply impacted by the loss of his older brother, Jesse Hatch, who was killed in action in Europe during World War II. After Jesse’s death, Hatch resolved to live two lives—one for himself and one for his brother.  This resolve drove Hatch to succeed in sports and other extracurricular activities. In high school, he played on the varsity basketball team, fought as an amateur boxer, and served as student body president. He brought his passion for music, athletics, and student government with him to Brigham Young University in 1952. To pay his way through college, Hatch worked as a janitor during the school year and as a journeyman lather in the summers."

At Baldwin High School, Orrin was captain of the basketball team and president of the student body. He took two years off for missionary work, proselytizing in Ohio, and graduated in 1955. He then moved to Utah and worked as a union lathe operator to pay his way through Brigham Young University. In 1957, he married Elaine Hansen.

God of War Ragnarok is official – for a long time, the name of the game was assumed, and the rumour mill was working hard to try and dissuade fans that Ragnarok would indeed be the final suffix for the title. The game is already making some big promises: developer Sony’s Santa Monica Studio has promised that the incoming game will complete the Norse storyline from the 2018 game, God of War… so you know the stakes are going to be high. Fan appetite for the game is clearly quite high, too: God Of War Ragnarok currently has the most views of all the trailers released at the last Sony PlayStation Showcase that took place on September 9, 2021. Given that most of those trailers are well into the muiti-million hit-count, that’s impressive. God of War: Ragnarok currently sits at over 12million views. Whoever said that fan desire for Sony exclusives was on the decrease? The game will carry on more or less straight from the previous title, with Kratos and Atreus venturing once more into the ancient Norse world, attempting to put a halt to that eponymous world-ending Ragnarok. For everything you need to know about the game – including the God of War Ragnarok release date – read on below. pic.twitter."

But that isn’t quite certain yet, and we’re working as hard as we can to confirm that to you as soon as we can.” “For God of War, the project started a little later. So we’ve made the decision to push that game out to next year, to ensure that Santa Monica Studio can deliver the amazing God of War game that we all want to play.”    Christopher Judge, the voice actor behind Kratos, has revealed that God Of War: Ragnarok was delayed due to an illness he faced in 2019. Taking to Twitter, Judge stated “Ragnarok was delayed because of me” and explained that in 2019 he faced significant health issues leaving him unable to walk. The illness required “back surgery, both hips replaced, and knee surgery” as well as rehab, which Sony Santa Monica waited for him to recover from. Judge added that he received “nothing but love and support” from Sony Santa Monica, who “never said a word about the delay, and what caused it.” Grace Orlady, the senior manager of Santa Monica Studio, has already teased some key details about what we can expect from the game when it launches in a PlayStation Blog post. “As you can see in the trailer, we’re picking up a few years after the events of God of War (2018)."

In June 2021, head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, confirmed that the game had been delayed, partly due to the pandemic,[30] as he stated that there were issues getting access to performance capture and talent.[22] Santa Monica Studio issued a statement regarding the delay, which said that while they were focused on delivering a top-quality game, they also wanted to maintain the safety of those involved with the development.[31]  The delay brought a unique issue with Atreus actor Sunny Suljic, who was going through puberty during the time of production. Due to the change in his voice, supervising dialogue designer Jodie Kupsco said \"We had to go in and even out that performance so [that in the game] it sounds like it took place over a short period of time\"."

We additionally strongly encourage demonstrations of industrial systems that are technologically innovative given the current state of the art of theory and applied research in natural language processing. Each submitted demonstration must be accompanied by a submitted paper describing the system (see below). Areas of interest include all topics related to theoretical and applied natural language processing, such as (but not limited to) the topics listed on the main conference website. We especially welcome systems for model analysis and interpretation. Submitted systems may be of the following types: Papers describing accepted demonstrations will be published in a companion volume of the EMNLP 2022 conference proceedings. Please note: Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate in the Demonstrations Program and should be arranged as part of the Exhibit Program. As in previous years, EMNLP 2022’s demo track will feature a Best Demo Award.  The award is for the best demo, and not for the best paper. That is to say, it will be judged by a person who actually interacts with the demo. All deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h (“anywhere on Earth”)."

The introduction to the film would have seen the audience introduced to the \"real world\" during the 1960s, after which the opening of the game would have been recreated. Our protagonist, Jack, would survive a plane crash, and would have discovered a Lighthouse. (The film would have provided the reason for him being on the plane as trying to flee from \"the mandatory career his dad set up for him right out of college\". ) He would have taken a bathysphere trip down to the ocean floor to discover the city of Rapture.  Jack  would have listened to Andrew Ryan's opening monologue, presumably while in the bathysphere. As in the game, the bathysphere would have been attacked when it arrived in Rapture. Then, Jack would have gotten contacted by a character named Atlas via a short-wave radio.  After the initial attack, the Splicers would have been introduced to the audience as they descended from the ceilings \"like spiders."

The company is building products and services for parents who utilize Medicaid.  The healthcare system is especially difficult for women of color to navigate: Medical research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found they often must advocate for themselves more than white women to receive adequate treatment, as Serena Williams' near-death birthing experience made clear for many.  Maven pairs every user with a patient advocate who helps connect them with the right providers, schedule appointments, and find additional resources. It also lists providers who have experience with certain communities to better tailor the health journey to the patient. \"I want to change the health of the world, one woman and one family at a time, and really provide more access to care,\" she told Insider. \"My goal is to fill the gaps in care with a reimagined care model for women and families.\"  In an Equity Talk, Insider's new series featuring executives discussing their work to advance social justice, Ryder shared her vision for the company and how she was strengthening diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) for customers and employees.

For her, teasing out the narrative in a piece of reporting is a similar skill to finding the right business model to address a market demand. Once you find that signal, you build the product or write the story. After completing Paulson’s memoir, Ryder decamped to Southeast Asia, where she served as a journalist for The Economist and The Wall Street Journal. From there she transitioned into venture capital, another industry where being able to spot the trends with staying power has outsized importance. Her experience on the VC side of the table would come in handy when she would later pitch investors on the idea that would become Maven. As Maven’s business has scaled, Ryder’s storytelling impulses have served her well, whether it’s attracting talent and investors, closing sales, or building a brand identity. All of these functions require Ryder to build a compelling narrative around the need for better healthcare options for women and their families. Finding the Maven Story Ryder’s story for Maven goes like this: When her friends started to have kids, she saw something had to change. Having a child was a monumental event, she believed, affecting a woman’s body, their personal life, and their professional life."

He becomes a monarch at the age of 73. But there are a number of practical - and traditional - steps which he must go through to be crowned King. Charles was born at Buckingham Palace on 14 November 1948. He was 4 years old when his mother was crowned as Queen Elizabeth II.  Instead of being tutored at the palace, his education was in school. He attended Hill House in West London, Cheam Preparatory School in Berkshire and Gordonstoun in Eastern Scotland. In 1969, at the age of 20, he was invested by the Queen as Prince of Wales at Caerfarnon Castle. Before the investiture, the then prince learnt Welsh at University College of Wales in Aberystwyth. He married Lady Diana Spencer on 29 July 1981 at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. From that marriage they had two sons: Prince William, born on 21 June 1982; and Prince Harry, born on 15 September 1984. Their marriage was dissolved on 28 August 1996, although The Princess of Wales continued to live at Kensington Palace and to carry out her public work. Lady Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997."

Luthor is one of the most menacing and cunning villains ever, having bested Superman several times using nothing but his wits. Titans will stay true to Luthor’s comic persona. \"He has a very sensitive, thoughtful approach to evil and power. You know what he's done, what he's capable of doing, except like many of those people, he's personable. He doesn't have a cat on his lap. Yeah.

It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]  This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.  Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002."

The new product will find Apple competing directly against Meta’s Quest Pro (rumored for a release next month), and PlayStation VR. According to the filing, Apple’s headset could offer both gaming and FaceTime functionality, along with health and educational features. While Meta’s devices have been used for some medical training, they weren’t designed with such use cases in mind.

Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown."

The headset mask (which Apple dubs a “Light Seal”) and strap (which Apple dubs a “Head Band”) are cloth-lined and modular, and Apple says they can flex to fit to a variety of face shapes and head sizes. The Head Band is ribbed and fits around the back of your head, and you can swap different sizes and styles of band. Zeiss has created custom optical inserts that magnetically attach to the lenses for people who wear glasses. It has an external battery that lasts up to two hours and can connect via a “supple woven cable” so it slips into a pocket, or you can plug it into external power and use it all day. Apple promises that the display will be unprecedentedly sharp and can deliver 4K video. The system uses an M2, but it also includes a new chip called the R1. You’re also not, Apple promises, isolated from people around you. The headset will display your eyes with a system called EyeSight, and if you’re in full VR, a glowing screen will obscure them to suggest you’re not available."

The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what’s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies’ fallen standing in Virginia, Tech’s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina’s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role."

Perrette and Discovery streaming CFO Neil Chugani (who would become CNN's CFO) were also there. Licht expressed his skepticism with the product's programming, according to people in the meeting.

In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel.

Whereas if it has its own style, they have to kind of meet it halfway and pull their stuff out of it. Which is interesting. It’s a little scary for me because I see how it could be used for good and evil.” As Midjourney is intended to be open by default, it has strict policies on ensuring that content is PG-13. It automatically blocks text inputs that are inherently disrespectful, aggressive, abusive or sexual, Holz confirmed Most importantly, the rules are enforced for all content, including interactions in private mode.  Midjourney currently offers a limited “freemium” model that allows users to submit 20-25 prompts for image generation. After that, users can choose from a range of subscription packages — ranging from a basic membership package of 200 images, a standard membership, which includes unlimited images — or a premium corporate membership, which includes both unlimited images and complete privacy.  It’s important to note that “corporate membership” does not refer to an enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) product. In fact, Holz explicitly mentioned that the company has no interest in building one either, even though they have many customers who use the product to make commercial video games, concept art and videos."

We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community."

Holz said a lot of graphic artists use Midjourney as part of their concept development workflow. They generate a few variations on an idea and present it to clients to see which direction they should pursue. \"The professionals are using it to supercharge their creative or communication process,\" Holz explained. \"And then a lot of people were just playing with it.\" Maybe 20 percent of people use Midjourney for what Holz describes as art therapy.

Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle."

She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15 realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history.  Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021.

The queen's piper played a lament on a bagpipe, which was followed by a blessing by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the singing of the national anthem. \"Go forth into the world in peace; Be of good courage, hold fast that which is good, render to no one evil for evil; strengthen the fainthearted, support the weak, help the afflicted, honor all people, love and serve the Lord, rejoicing in the power of the Holy Spirit; and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit be among you and remain with you always. Amen,\" Justin Welby said. After the queen's coffin was lowered into the vault, the king and other royal family members left the chapel and the public events for the day were concluded. The committal service for Queen Elizabeth II got underway Monday afternoon at St. George's Chapel on the royal family's Windsor estate."

Users on Netflix's cheapest plan will also lose the ability to download shows and movies to their devices for offline viewing. The main difference will come during the viewing experience. Netflix says that viewers will get an \"average of 4 to 5 minutes of ads\" per hour of content. These ads will be either 15 or 30 seconds long, and will play at both the beginning of shows and films as well as throughout. Switching is simple, with reps for Netflix confirming to CNBC Make It that the process is the same as it has always been. Users need only sign into their account on a computer or smartphone and then search for \"Plan Details\" under their account settings. There they will see the option to \"Change Plan\" and will be able to select from all four of the streamer's plans. Once the ad-supported plan has been selected, the change will kick into effect at the user's next billing date.

Basic with Ads subscribers also won’t be able to download series and films to their devices for offline viewing, and won’t have access to about 5% to 10% of Netflix’s content catalog due to licensing restrictions. Peters said in October that the missing titles will be “a very small minority of viewing” that the company will work to reduce over time. Popular shows currently not available with Basic with Ads include Arrested Development, Friday Night Lights, The Good Place, House of Cards, Knight Rider, The Last Kingdom, The Magicians, New Girl, Peaky Blinders, Queen of the South, The Sinner, and Uncoupled, Variety reports. Movies include 28 Days, Blue Jasmine, The Butler, Casino Royale, The Hateful Eight, The Imitation Game, Made of Honor, Man on a Ledge, The Mist, Morbius, Oblivion, Phantom Thread, Quantum of Solace, Rambo, Robin Hood, Skyfall, and Steve Jobs. To change your Netflix plan to Basic with Ads, hover over your profile icon in the top right corner of Netflix’s home screen, and then select “Account” in the dropdown menu that appears. Next, click “Change plan” in the “Plan Details” section of the page and select Basic with Ads."

                "node_text": "Same as Netflix, most other streamers reserve their 4K HDR streams for their ad-free subscribers, although that’s not a universal policy; Paramount+, for one, does allow ad-supported subscribers to stream in 4K. Netflix Standard with Ads subscribers will have to sit through 4-5 minutes of commercials per hour, with the ads running at the beginning and during videos. Each ad will be either 15 or 30 seconds. That 4-5 minute per hour figure is pretty much in line with Netflix’s competitors. For example, the “with ads” version of HBO Max averages about four minutes an hour, while Peacock tops out at about five minutes per hour.  It’s also worth noting that Netflix isn’t putting ads in children’s programming or in “new” Netflix Originals movies. Nope, not everything. Netflix licenses many of its movies and TV shows from third parties, including some Netflix Originals, and those agreements will need to be renegotiated before Netflix can insert ads into those videos for streaming.  According to Netflix chief operating officer Greg Peters, anywhere between 5 and 10 percent of programming on Netflix’s ad-free tiers will be unavailable for “with ads” users, although Peters says the streamer will “work to reduce that number over time."

Yes, you can stay at the Sicilian hotel from season two of ‘The White Lotus’ As much as you might dislike many of the – admittedly very dislikeable – characters of HBO’s breakout TV hit ‘The White Lotus’, there’s no denying the appeal of the show’s filming locations. The first season, which was set in Hawaii and revolved around the interactions between the guests and employees of a fictional resort chain, was full of spectacular backdrops and seriously enviable bits of luxury."

RELATED: The Craziest 'White Lotus' Season 2 Theories That Didn't Happen The first season of The White Lotus takes place in the Hawaiian resort, which is decorated and designed to reflect the local cultural practices (or at least the way that they are perceived by tourists); there’s a particularly entertaining storyline where the hotel manager Armond (Murray Bartlett) and the brutish guest Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) get into a dispute over the “Pineapple Room.” In reality, the Four Seasons Maui features one-bedroom suites that overlook Wailea Beach and cost over $9,000 a night. White had grown interested in telling a story set in Hawaii after filming episodes of his show Enlightened. He said that “the colonial legacy is still a living issue,” and that he learned more about the United States’ annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the lack of self-determination granted to Indigenous groups as a result of his experience."

With a vision of “Joyful Rendezvous upon Pure Ice and Snow,” Beijing 2022 built on the legacies of the landmark Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and encouraged 300 million people across China to embrace winter sports. The 109 events in seven Olympic winter sports were held in the three competition zones of central Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou. Beijing hosted four snow events (snowboard big air and freestyle skiing big air, men’s and women’s), plus all the ice events (curling, ice hockey and skating), making use of the legacy venues of Beijing 2008. Yanqing, a suburban district of Beijing (80km to the northwest) and home to the famous Badaling and Juyongguan stretches of the Great Wall, hosted the Alpine skiing and sliding (bobsleigh, skeleton and luge) events. Zhangjiakou, further to the northwest in the neighbouring Hebei province, hosted all the other snow events (snowboard, freestyle skiing, cross country skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined and biathlon) in its Chongli district, a popular skiing destination."

For nearly the entirety of Chicago P.D. Season 10, Upton (Tracy Spiradakos) was dedicated to solving the case of Sean O'Neal's sex trafficking ring. And by the series' midseason finale, titled \"Proof of Burden,\" she does just that and arrests Sean despite him nearly losing his life. Watch Chicago P.D. on NBC and Peacock. Remember, this happened on the heels of Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer) resigning and leaving Chicago in Season 10, Episode 3. That, plus the Sean storyline, took Upton to \"such a bad place,\" showrunner Gwen Sigan tells NBC Insider. It's obvious that she's been using the investigation to distract from her husband's absence. \"The thing that [Sean and Upton] have is this obsession that she wants to get him. And because of that, she’s allowed herself to fully get into his headspace,\" Sigan says. \"I think she knows everything about him up to that point... And so it’s just this twisted relationship that's really interesting to write."

We really see what that home life is like now that he’s not there. And also it’s just this big open question of: What does it mean for her and what does it mean for her marriage? She’s still married to him and yet he’s living overseas. And she doesn’t know when he’s coming back.\" It looks like we'll be ringing in the New Year with even more Upstead angst!  Chicago P.D. Season 10 will return with new episodes on Wednesday, January 4. Get your fix by watching previous Chicago P.D. episodes now on  Peacock.

Del Toro, 58, delivered another epic speech when accepting his third career statuette, this time for a film that took nearly 10 years to produce. \"Animation is cinema,\" Del Toro said. \"Animation is ready to be taken to the next level. Let's keep it in the conversation, help us. I want to thank the love of my life, Kim, my children, my mother, my father who are here with me (in his heart). I am their son and I love them.\" Del Toro's Pinocchio beat out other animated pictures such as Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, The Sea Beast and Turning Red. This award places Del Toro on the podium of Mexican directors with most Oscars won, equaling Emmanuel Lubezki with three and trailing only Alejando Gonzalez Ińarritu at four and Alfonso Cuaron, who leads the group with five statuettes.

The playoffs began on April 16 and ended on June 16 with the conclusion of the 2022 NBA Finals. The playoffs also returned to its normal April–June schedule for the first time since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in two postponements in 2020 and 2021.  Eight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.  The NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021–22 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.[12]  Each conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding."

In that scenario, Microsoft's bid of $95 per share will likely decrease, and Activision shareholders could be compensated in a separate transaction for the popular franchise. Meanwhile, the third regulatory body, the CMA, is expected to release its full report on April 26, 2023. Australia, Japan, and New Zealand are also expected to weigh in on the deal but have yet to do so.  As a stand-alone company, Activision Blizzard stock isn't too appealing, with revenue and diluted earnings per share falling roughly 14% and 37%, respectively, from 2021 to 2022. Also, longtime CEO Bobby Kotick has faced scrutiny over the past couple of years for allegedly harboring a \"culture of sexual misconduct,\" according to a Wall Street Journal report. As a merger arbitrage play -- a short-term investing strategy of buying stocks of companies trading below their acquisition price -- the stock remains interesting, since Activision is trading 24% below its acquisition price. Even Warren Buffett, arguably the world's most successful investor, is participating in the merger arbitrage. Shortly after the acquisition announcement, Buffett added roughly 54 million shares of Activision Blizzard to Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio."

Under the deal, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, who has faced calls to resign over the cultural problems within his company, will remain CEO during the transition. Microsoft said Activision as a company will report to Microsoft's Xbox boss Phil Spencer after the deal closes, implying Kotick could depart after the transition. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday afternoon Kotick is expected to step down after the deal closes. Microsoft said it expects to close the deal in its fiscal 2023. However, U.S. regulators have signaled they will be far more aggressive in evaluating large acquisitions, especially in the tech industry, so there's a chance the deal dies under government review. Microsoft has gotten more aggressive with gaming over the past several years. It bought Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5 billion in 2014. And last year, Microsoft completed a $7.5 billion acquisition of game maker Bethesda. The deal also plays into a long-term vision for Microsoft as it competes with Meta (formerly Facebook) to build technologies to create a virtual world called the metaverse. In fact, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was the first Big Tech CEO to publicly acknowledge the value of the metaverse, months before Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Today, virtual worlds are dominated by gaming, but the hope is they expand to cater to other demographics and replace a lot of traditional social networking activity online."

According to Kotick, this led to the idea of Microsoft, which does have those capabilities, acquiring Activision Blizzard at an attractive price point.[15] Spencer further had stated that Microsoft's intent with the acquisition is access to Activision's mobile games, which would include those by its King division such as Candy Crush Saga. He said that while there are 200 million game console users worldwide, the mobile market reaches over 3 billion people.[16] In a statement released on Activision Blizzard's investor website, the company said its industry is the \"most dynamic and exciting category of entertainment across all platforms\" and that gaming will be the forefront of the development of the emerging metaverse. Some journalists saw this acquisition, and Microsoft's March 2021 acquisition of Bethesda Softworks, as a bid to compete against Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook.[17][12][13]  The announcement had come in the wake of events related to California Department of Fair Employment and Housing v. Activision Blizzard, a lawsuit raised in July 2021 accusing the company of sexual harassment, employment discrimination and retaliation on the part of Activision Blizzard.[18][19] Allegations had expanded by November 2021 to include actions that Activision Blizzard's CEO Bobby Kotick had done."

Its involvement may offer a mark of legitimacy as esports goes through a downturn in investor confidence and many companies are struggling financially. Importantly, Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch League and Call of Duty League are floundering. Franchise owners reportedly started collective bargaining against the company due to high costs and missed promises on revenue. Most sponsors also left the leagues following Activision Blizzard’s sexual harassment lawsuits.  In a recent financial filing, Activision Blizzard quietly stated that its leagues “continue to face headwinds which are negatively impacting the operations and, potentially, the longevity of the leagues under the current business model.” In light of that, big-money and big-name support from Microsoft could help turn around their fortunes.  On the other hand, its potential new owner might not be as invested in Activision Blizzard’s grand franchising experiments, and make decisions based on their current financial footing — which could potentially see a downsizing, or even cancellation, of the leagues. Activision Blizzard and Microsoft will want to find a way to get along with regulators in the US and UK in much the same way they did with the EU, by agreeing to a set of demands. But the UK already rejected Microsoft’s remedies when it blocked the deal. Overturning that decision via the appeals process will mean convincing regulators that the CMA made a mistake in its first decision, a difficult task."

She first came to national prominence when she was a runner up on America’s Got Talent at ten years of age. Her voice was spectacular, and a big part of the draw was hearing that amazing sound coming from such a young person.  But Jackie Evancho is no longer a child, and in Carousel of Time she turns her fantastic voice to the music of Joni Mitchell. Mitchell, a major force in the counterculture music of the 1960s, had a remarkable knack for writing unique melodies along with thoughtful and insightful lyrics which explored relationships and reflections on life. Even though the melodies were catchy, Mitchell’s tunes always highlighted the lyrics. The popular “Both Sides Now” is a prime example. So, by covering ten of Mitchell’s compositions, Evancho has given herself the opportunity to create an album which sounds like more than just an opportunity to show off her voice. Evancho has had a difficult couple of years, breaking her back in a car accident and recently revealing that she has an eating disorder. The sensitivity with which she delivers these songs suggests that there is something about them that resonates deeply with her. Consequently, in hearing her sing them, they resonate with us as well.

But Carousel of Time is Jackie’s own glimpse of hope after a dark season, a reminder that songs like Joni’s ‘Both Sides Now’ or ‘River’, could heal someone all the more than they may even realise. Yes, Jackie has a long way to go for complete and full healing from this eating disorder. But she’s nevertheless well on her way. An artist that is well beyond her years, musically and sonically, this is a must-purchase, especially if you’ve been a fan of Jackie’s material in the past and are eager to see what she’s doing now in the meantime, between originally written projects. Well done Jackie for this emotional, compelling, and heartfelt album. Maybe, just maybe, people can see that Joni’s music (and Jackie’s originals and covers) still has meaning and purpose even now, compared to whence, when and where these songs were written and originally recorded all those years ago. Looking forward to the next original album, whenever that arises. Here’s hoping this album continues to impact and influence, until then.   3 songs to listen to: Circle Game, Both Sides Now, A Case of You Score: 4."

Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle."

It blows “Avatar’s” $26.7 million first day in 2009 out of the water, though that didn’t include Thursday previews.  An estimated 66% of the $435 million opening weekend revenue came from worldwide 3D ticket sales.  Travis Reid, CEO at 3D company RealD, set a “new benchmark for the current 3D marketplace.” Over $48.8 million of the global total came from IMAX screens alone (1,543 in 80 markets), the company’s second biggest weekend. “As excited as we are about these early results, we anticipate a long and successful run for ‘Avatar: The Way of Water,’” said Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX, in a statement. As with many ambitious Cameron projects, from “Titanic” to the first “Avatar,” nerves were high for the costly sequel, one of the most expensive of all time, which began production five years ago. It faced repeated delays and weathered The Walt Disney Co’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019. It’s also one of four “Avatar” sequels Cameron had in mind. Filming on the third movie, which shot simultaneously with “The Way of Water,” is done, with an expected release in December 2024."

But the far-right leader remained defiant. She denounced “two weeks of unfair, brutal and violent methods” to prevent her win, and she said that “tonight’s result represents in itself a resounding victory.” Macron vs. Le Pen 2022: What to know about France’s presidential election runoff Sunday’s result marked the far right’s best finish in a French presidential election. It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen’s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream. Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power."

We can only hope that this brings more foldables from other manufactures to the US, as more competition is always better. Keep your eyes peeled on June 27th if you're looking to pick one up at launch.

The phone started shipping on June 27, following the lift of the review embargo for Google's first foldable. Reviews across the web were mixed though our Pixel Fold review was largely positive. We found that Google nailed the versatility of the foldable experience with a powerful processor and excellent cameras.   The Google Pixel Fold is available in a choice of Porcelain (off-white) or Obsidian (black) shades, and other than its large camera bump it has a rather sleek design. In fact, at 139.7 x 158.7 x 5.8mm when unfolded, it’s the thinnest foldable phone on the market. That remains true when it's folded, but it’s rather chunkier than a conventional phone in that form, at 139.7 x 79.5 x 12.1mm. But while the Google Pixel Fold is relatively slim compared to other foldables, it’s not one of the lightest options, coming in at 283g. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 – which is its closest competitor – is 263g. The Pixel Fold also has rather large bezels around its foldable display, as we already knew from leaks and teasers."

Amazon on Friday announced an agreement to acquire iRobot for approximately $1.7 billion. iRobot sells its robots worldwide and is most famous for the circular-shaped Roomba vacuum. NEW YORK — Amazon on Friday announced it has agreed to acquire the vacuum cleaner maker iRobot for approximately $1.7 billion, scooping up another company to add to its collection of smart home appliances amid broader concerns about its market power. iRobot sells its products worldwide and is most famous for the circular-shaped Roomba vacuum, which would join voice assistant Alexa, the Astro robot and Ring security cameras and others in the list of smart home features offered by the Seattle-based e-commerce and tech giant. The move is part of Amazon's bid to own part of the home space through services and accelerate its growth beyond retail, said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail."

Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.  Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time.

The last time Argentina came close to winning it was in 2014. Unfortunately, Messi’s side lost to Germany in the final. However this time the Argentinians are well prepared and are in form. They just won the Copa America last year and are unbeaten in 36 matches. Argentina are the favourites alongside Brazil to win the 2022 World Cup. Let’s assess the five potential knock-out stage opponents for Argentina in World Cup 2022. Provided that Argentina wins their group, they can face France in the Round Of 16. The last time this happened was in the 2018 World Cup but at Argentina’s demise. Deschamps France beat Argentina 4-3 in a thrilling match. However this time Argentina can surely manage to beat France. Not only is Argentina in great form but France itself is lacking several players. Karim Benzema, Nkunku, Kante and Pogba are set to miss the World Cup. The presence of Benzema and especially Kante would have been crucial to put down Argentina. Despite France missing out on some players, they can still manage to outdo Argentina because of their squad depth. Kylian Mbappe is definitely a player to watch out for as he showed up last time against Argentina."

Nevertheless, Susie is optimistic about her future. After all, she has the two things needed by every character descendant from that great forbearer of cinematic gifted children, Tracy Flick: a passion project and an upstart work ethic. Susie hosts, produces, and exhaustively researches a true crime podcast called “Susie Searches,” and she’s determined to boost its reach. Even if that means kidnapping her TikTok meditation guru classmate Jesse Wilcox (Alex Wolff), and then rescuing him on tape. It goes where you think it will go from there — she gets kind of famous and likes it, but also gets anxious. Someone finds out, she accidentally kills them, the tension mounts, she can’t bear it. Her hubris, her naïvete, her comeuppance—culminating in the final shot! Kargman employs a lot of bells and whistles — a poppy color palette, animated embellishments, constant voiceover, inventive cut sequences — and they clang and gong loudly. Yet Susie Searches is still, curiously, a downbeat and even melancholic film. In fact all the aesthetic reverie comes to seem an attempted cover, or even apology for a film that can barely force its painted-on grin."

So while not without its flaws, there is still a lot to like about what Kargman puts on-screen. It showcases hubris incarnate as it destroys a “good” person by pushing her into corners that demand “bad” decisions to be made. Clemons is great in the role too. There’s always a keen sense of artifice that contradicts the way so many others see her smile as a sign of purity rather than a mask hiding the fact that her intelligence has corrupted her moral compass. Wolff excels by being her antithesis—morality refusing to bend to stardom. I like that it all gets darker as it continues and plays with earlier set-ups in perhaps surprising ways, but the pacing does leave a bit to be desired. A solid, imperfect debut.

When he goes missing, she pivots to figuring out his whereabouts. Director Sophie Kargman and screenwriter William Day Frank’s (based on their short film of the same name) Susie Searches quickly moves from expository build-up to this central hunt as a result. And what might seem altruistic at first gradually devolves into full-blown avarice. Because Susie’s motivations aren’t pure. She’s not doing this because she cares about Jessie’s well-being (although he is cute). She’s doing it because she wants to piggyback off his notoriety. The reason’s simple: Susie is all but invisible to everyone but her mother. The sheriff’s department (David Walton’s Deputy Graham and Jim Gaffigan’s Sheriff Loggins) see her as a weirdly intrusive intern. Classmates as a curve-breaker. And co-workers (Rachel Sennott’s Jillian) as a pariah. Doing this one thing could change her entire life. At what cost, though? The instant one falls down the slippery slope of pursuing celebrity rather than letting it find them is the instant they become a slave to the process regardless of where it leads."

In accepting the directing award, Kwan subverted the Asian dad trope by telling his son that winning an Oscar is not normal — and he won’t have to live up to this. Scheinert used his speech to underscore that drag should not be under attack, as it has been from conservative activists. “We want to dedicate this to the mommies, all the mommies of the world, to our moms, specifically to my mom and dad, Ken and Becky, thank you for not squashing my creativity when I was making really disturbing horror films or really perverted comedy films or dressing in drag as a kid — which is a threat to nobody,” Scheinert said.",

By Bob Mondello No matter who takes home the gold statuettes tonight, 2023 will be remembered as a watershed year for Asian actors at the Oscars. Four Oscar nominations for Asian performers in a single year is a record. Three of them – Michelle Yeoh, who is competing for best actress, Ke Huy Quan (best supporting actor) and Stephanie Hsu (best supporting actress) – play the laundromat-owning multiverse-hopping family in Everything Everywhere All at Once. Also in the supporting actress category is Hong Chau, who plays the best friend of Brendan Fraser's title character in The Whale. While there are also Asian directors and screenwriters among this year’s nominees, in other respects, 2023 represents a step back from diversity for the Motion Picture Academy. With no Black actors nominated for lead performances and no women feature directors nominated, there are still areas of the multiverse that need exploring. Check out our interviews with Ke Huy Quan and Michelle Yeoh and read more about this record nominations year."

Earlier this month, we reported that AMD was going to host an event in late August where they will announce all the details such as specs and prices for their next-gen Ryzen 7000 \"Zen 4\" CPUs and the respective AM5 platform. The company had also planned to open up sales just two weeks later on the 15th of September. But it looks like AMD has decided to halt the sales a bit and position the real launch next to Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs on the 27th of September. Intel is expected to host its \"Innovation\" event on the 27th of September where the company will unveil its latest desktop processors codenamed Raptor Lake. The CPUs won't be available until October however, AMD's Ryzen 7000 CPUs will be ready for the mass consumer market. This may seem like AMD being very confident to launch their chips right when their competitor announces their next-gen parts."

Of course, the ever-present elephant in the room is the ongoing semiconductor shortage. Though the Zen 4 CPUs are slated to launch on September 27, we're not sure how readily available they'll be. After all, we’ve already seen Intel delay its Arc desktop GPUs to the latter half of this year because of the effects of the global pandemic. With luck, AMD can launch its new processors without incident. Incidentally enough, a new leak alleges that Intel will launch its Raptor Lake CPUs a month after AMD's processors. If this is accurate, prospective CPU buyers will have to choose between Team Red and Team Blue. Stay tuned for more updates.

They are five-time European Champions Cup winners and have won the domestic league, the Top 14, 21 times in their history. They won both of those competitions in 2021 while Toulouse FC were being beaten in the Ligue 2 play-offs. Montpellier may have claimed their crown in June, but Ugo Mola’s team remain a powerhouse of the sport, playing a fast, carefree style of rugby that is lapped up by their fanbase. They have long been Toulouse’s sporting success story. When one acknowledges that US Colomiers Rugby play in the French second tier, the Prod D2, and Toulouse Olympique, the local rugby league side, are currently competing for the first time in the Super League — admittedly, their debut season will culminate in relegation — then it might be easy to assume the football club would struggle to find a niche in the city.

A second trailer was released in January, showcasing Mirren's villain Hespera and the Daughters of Atlas as they demand Billy and his friends give up their powers before the trio destroys the world.

But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense."

Al-Rawi said it was stressful to use the “full self-driving” beta because the software would sometimes try to hit curbs or drive on the wrong side of the road. His car would brake unexpectedly at times, triggering road rage from others.             “He promised your car can be a taxi. This is going to be generating income,” Al-Rawi said. “Unfortunately, none of this happened.”             Al-Rawi still believes that Tesla’s driver-assist features are better than any other automaker. He calls the automaker’s lane-keeping feature “fantastic.” The “full self-driving” feature, which navigates local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, is where Al-Rawi had problems."

Musk has positioned FSD technology as one of several artificial intelligence initiatives at Tesla.

Additionally, hospital data reporting will continue as required by the CMS conditions of participation through April 30, 2024, but reporting may be reduced from the current daily reporting to a lesser frequency. Certain FDA COVID-19-related guidance documents for industry that affect clinical practice and supply chains will end or be temporarily extended. FDA published several dozen guidance documents to address challenges presented by the COVID-19 PHE, including limitations in clinical practice or potential disruptions in the supply chain. FDA is in the process of addressing which policies are no longer needed and which should be continued, with any appropriate changes, and the agency will announce plans for each guidance prior to the end of the PHE. FDA’s ability to detect early shortages of critical devices related to COVID-19 will be more limited. During the PHE, manufacturers of certain devices related to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 have been required to notify the FDA “of a permanent discontinuance in the manufacture of the device” or “an interruption in the manufacture of the device that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption in the supply of that device in the United States.” This requirement will end when the PHE ends."

As described in previous communications, the Administration’s continued response is not entirely dependent on the COVID-19 PHE. There are significant flexibilities and actions that will not be affected as we transition from the current phase of our response.

Still, others will expire. Below is a list of some of the changes people will see in the months ahead. Certain Medicare and Medicaid waivers and broad flexibilities for health care providers are no longer necessary and will end. During the COVID-19 PHE, CMS has used a combination of emergency authority waivers, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance to ensure and expand access to care and to give health care providers the flexibilities needed to help keep people safe. States, hospitals, nursing homes, and others are currently operating under hundreds of these waivers that affect care delivery and payment and that are integrated into patient care and provider systems. Many of these waivers and flexibilities were necessary to expand facility capacity for the health care system and to allow the health care system to weather the heightened strain created by COVID-19; given the current state of COVID-19, this excess capacity is no longer necessary. CMS developed a roadmap for the eventual end of the COVID-19 PHE, which was published in August 2022, and has been sharing information on what health care facilities and providers can do to prepare for future emergencies. This includes facilities returning to normal operations and meeting CMS requirements that promote the safety and quality of care they provide."

With victory Swiatek extends her ranking points tally to 10,835 and surpasses 10,000 points accumulated over the season.She is the first woman to achieve that feat since Serena Williams in 2013. “I think this is going to be the season that I’m going to be thinking of for the rest of my life,” she said after winning the tournament. “On the other hand I would love to have season like that in the future. “I guess the best way to do that is to not focus on what happened but focusing on what’s next. I still know I have many things to improve so I’m looking forward to it.”      Iga Swiatek now has two WTA 500 titles, four 1000 titles and two Slam trophies in 2022. She has won eight of nine finals played this season. The Pole only lost to Barbora Krejcikova in the Czech Republic the week before San Diego. “Coming in here I wasn’t feeling completely sure that I was going to be able to perform my best,” Swiatek added.",

The mixing of the cultures and the different layers is just so exciting to see. The final act is a big Bollywood-inspired set piece at the wedding. It's really over the top and showcases the beauty of South Asian culture. [Then we also show the characters] at school, dressed in school uniforms, which are sort of British.  I'm also mixing all the genres I love; referencing all the movies I love. I would describe Polite Society as an action-comedy about sisterhood. The film is filled with action scenes; heights; crazy over-the-top violence, fun, and comedy. It was a chance for me to mix all the films I grew up on—the Jackie Chan and Bollywood movies.  Polite Society official trailer  For me, the action in the film really represents what it feels like to be a teenage girl—how it can feel so painful and violent when you're having fights at school, when you're fighting with your sister.

It was his first Wimbledon title and second major singles title overall.[1]  Alcaraz, Djokovic, and Daniil Medvedev were in contention for the men's singles No. 1 ranking. Alcaraz retained the No. 1 ranking with his victory, [2][3] and became the first player to qualify for the year-end championships.[4]  For the first time since Lleyton Hewitt in 2002, the top seed and winner of the event was not a member of the Big Four. Stan Wawrinka was attempting to complete the career Grand Slam, but was defeated by Djokovic in the third round.  Djokovic's loss ended his third major bid to become the first man to win all four Grand Slam events in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969.

With the headset on and controllers in hand, players will feel a heightened range of sensations unlike any other - thanks to the creativity of the game worlds being built by our world class developers, and the latest technology incorporated into the hardware.'\r  Sony additionally announced the PSVR 2 will feature a 110-degree field of view, a resolution of 2000×2040 per eye and frame rates of 90/120Hz. In a recent blog post, Sony has revealed the PlayStation VR2 headset design and a final design image for the PlayStation VR2 Sense controller. Eurogamer's Ian Higton has also shared their first impressions for the PSVR 2, after he got to go hands-on with the Playstation VR2. In July 2022, a new blog from PlayStation unveiled the user experience features that will be available from launch.

The PSVR 2 is VR's biggest hardware device in years, but you need a PlayStation 5 to use it. Sony's first big accessory for the PlayStation 5, the PlayStation VR 2 headset, is here. We reviewed it recently: It's one of the best immersive gaming experiences we've ever had, and has some great games already, but it also costs more than the PlayStation 5 itself. Yeah, you read that right: The PSVR 2 costs $550. It's expensive, but if you're OK with tethering to a PlayStation 5 with a long cable, this could be the hardware for you, as opposed to waiting for the Meta Quest 3 or Apple's expected VR headset.  The PSVR 2 isn't wireless, but its higher-res HDR OLED display and advanced vibrating controllers, along with perks like eye tracking and in-headset rumble, give it a lot of hardware advantages. But its game library feels a little incomplete at the moment. If you're interested in one, you might want to wait and see what other games arrive throughout the year. Also, if you're interested in comparing it to the Quest 2 (the most popular VR headset of the last few years), we've got you covered there too."

Haptic feedback is also featured in the new sense controllers of the PS VR2 itself. Based on the trailers and announcements we’ve seen, this is the full list of games we are expecting to see available on PS VR2 when it eventually launches: As well as confirming the name of the headset in January 2022, Sony also revealed how an original game, Horizon Call of the Mountain, is being developed specifically for the PS VR2. This will be the first of many next-generation VR titles coming to the PS5; as with the current PS VR, it is likely some games will be entirely VR-based, while others will include an element of VR, but not rely entirely on the headset to function. PlayStation fans were recently shown a trailer of Call of the Mountain in PlayStation’s June State of Play. A few other PS VR2 compatible games were also announced at the State of Play event, such as a virtual reality version of Capcom’s Resident Evil 8 and the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. During an investment briefing at Sony in late May 2022, the company gave more details about its planned software releases for the new headset. A slide from the presentation has shown that the company plans to launch the PS VR2 with more than 20 games."

Nishino said the design was also inspired by the PS5 family of products, including its black and white aesthetic and rounded edges of the DualSense Wireless controller and the Pulse 3D Wireless headset.\r  While its also not too dissimilar to its predecessor's design, Sony has confirmed a new vent design promises better airflow and avoids having the lens fog up during game sessions. The PS VR2 also offers improved comfort thanks to a slimmer, lighter design and an adjustable lens so you can optimize your view. What's your thoughts? Will you be upgrading to the new PSVR 2?

The team is coached by Matt Rhule, who was named Nebraska's thirty-first head coach on November 26, 2022.[1]  Six past Nebraska head coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Eddie N. Robinson, Fielding H. Yost, Dana X. Bible, Biff Jones, Bob Devaney, and Tom Osborne. Osborne is the program's all-time leader in most major categories; his .836 career winning percentage is fourth-highest in major college football history.[2] Thirteen Nebraska coaches have won a conference championship at the school, and Devaney and Osborne combined to win five national titles.  The program's first extended period of success came under the leadership of W.C. Cole and Ewald O. Stiehm. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four consecutive games without a loss, still a program record.[3] Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-three seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Devaney was hired in 1962."

The second-year Nebraska AD, originally from Eastern Iowa, traveled separately from the Huskers to attend the final game of the season. An introductory news conference in Lincoln for Rhule could come as early as Sunday. Nebraska officials, without direct instruction from Alberts on the timing, have reserved the Hawks Championship Center for use to stage a hiring event. Rhule’s personality will mesh with the state of Nebraska. He’s a New York native and thrived as a head coach in Pennsylvania and Texas. So he’s adaptable. Nebraskans will like his work ethic and the respect that he’s shown already for the Nebraska program, which has won or shared five national titles. He said Saturday on ESPN’s “College GameDay” that he grew up “revering” the Huskers. Rhule talked before the announcement with former coach Tom Osborne and praised the leadership at the university, including Joseph, the well-liked former Nebraska QB who coached the team for the final nine games this season after Frost was fired. — Sherman He’s big on building culture, a must for Nebraska — which has lacked an identity on offense for far too long. Rhule emphasizes physical play. His track record at Temple and Baylor backs it up. Nebraska talked a big game about physicality under Frost, but its play on the field belied that message."

We additionally strongly encourage demonstrations of industrial systems that are technologically innovative given the current state of the art of theory and applied research in natural language processing. Each submitted demonstration must be accompanied by a submitted paper describing the system (see below). Areas of interest include all topics related to theoretical and applied natural language processing, such as (but not limited to) the topics listed on the main conference website. We especially welcome systems for model analysis and interpretation. Submitted systems may be of the following types: Papers describing accepted demonstrations will be published in a companion volume of the EMNLP 2022 conference proceedings. Please note: Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate in the Demonstrations Program and should be arranged as part of the Exhibit Program. As in previous years, EMNLP 2022’s demo track will feature a Best Demo Award.  The award is for the best demo, and not for the best paper. That is to say, it will be judged by a person who actually interacts with the demo. All deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h (“anywhere on Earth”)."

Sony Interactive Entertainment (a subsidiary of Sony behind the PlayStation brand) holds 14.09 percent of FromSoftware’s shares; Sixjoy Hong Kong Limited (a subsidiary of Tencent) owns 16.25 percent, bringing the collective stake to 30.34 percent. Kadokawa still maintains majority ownership at 69.66 percent. In the announcement, Kadokawa explained that the three companies had operated a “strategic alliance in the anime and game fields” since October 2021. Kadokawa said these recent investments would be used to further expand FromSoftware’s expansion into the global market and strengthen the triumvirate formed with Tencent and Sony. “Through the implementation of the fund procurement,” Kadokawa wrote in its press release, “FromSoftware will aim to proactively invest in development of more powerful game IP for itself to strengthen FromSoftware’s development capabilities and will seek to establish a framework that allows the expansion of the scope of its own publishing in the significantly growing global market."

                "node_text": "The Souls games by FromSoftware ranked, including ‘Elden Ring’ Dark Souls (FromSoftware’s most recognizable action role-playing series), “Bloodborne” and “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” are all brutally punishing games. Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options. FromSoftware has long been a highly praised and well-respected developer. But after “Elden Ring,” it’s now seen as a hitmaker."

But fixating on the areas where these tools fall short risks missing what’s so amazing about what they get right. When the new Bing works, it’s not just a better search engine. It’s an entirely new way of interacting with information on the internet, one whose full implications I’m still trying to wrap my head around. Kevin Scott, the chief technology officer of Microsoft, and Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, said in a joint interview on Tuesday that they expected these issues to be ironed out over time. It’s still early days for this kind of A.I., they said, and it’s too early to predict the downstream consequences of putting this technology in billions of people’s hands. “With any new technology, you don’t perfectly forecast all of the issues and mitigations,” Mr. Altman said. “But if you run a very tight feedback loop, at the rate things are evolving, I think we can get to very solid products very fast.” For now, only one thing seems clear: After years of stagnation and stasis, Microsoft and OpenAI have made search interesting again. After I turn in this column, I’m going to do something I thought I’d never do: I’m switching my desktop computer’s default search engine to Bing."

Your email has been sent      Learn what Prometheus means for Microsoft’s approach to artificial intelligence.   Microsoft has launched an AI-powered update of its Bing search engine. It’s not surprising, as we’ve lived with the same algorithmic approach to search since the launch of Google more than 20 years ago, so any innovation is going to get attention. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has called it “a Mosaic moment” — referring to the early internet browser and pointing to a very interesting future for software. Before the Mosaic browser, the World Wide Web was simply a way to explore and share documents; after the early browser launched in 1993, it became the user interface to the wider internet. AI in Bing is much the same, as it’s the start of a series of experiments that could change the way we interact with software. Jump to: At the heart of Microsoft’s AI-enhanced search is the same co-pilot assistive AI concept it’s using with its developer tools. The AI isn’t what drives the process — the user does. Switch to the chat feature, and what you get is a way to refine your queries and manage how they’re displayed. For example, I used it to generate a set of instructions for a relatively complex feature I’ve been struggling to use on a new camera."

Results are parsed and used as inputs into the model, looking for fresh insights that can drive additional searches, an approach that Microsoft described as a “virtuous loop.” The initial implementation of this AI tooling is in both its Edge browser and Bing search engine. Microsoft gave a picture of how the service will eventually appear in the rest of the company’s productivity tooling. In Edge, a new Bing sidebar lets you take searches outside the traditional browser, giving a clue to how it could be implemented in the familiar Office applications. The new sidebar design Microsoft has been rolling out across Office is very much like the Bing AI tooling that’s being trialed in the developer release of the Edge browser. While Microsoft has yet to announce any plans to provide API-level access to this tooling, it would be surprising if it wasn’t on the company’s radar. Microsoft is first and foremost a platform company, and its use of generative AI is clearly setting a pointer to what it thinks its next platform should be — assistive AI.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is an action role-playing game with a large open world. Unlike previous Xenoblade games, the game allows for up to seven party members to participate in battles at once, including the main party of six and an additional \"Hero\" character. Up to 19 Heroes can be recruited to the party through story events or sidequests, each with different skills and abilities. Party members also have the ability to change their character class, granting them access to different abilities; raising a Hero's affinity with the party will unlock their class for use. Like the previous entries, the game has an open world design, with a day-and-night time cycle that affects in-game events, such as the availability of quests and items. The game takes place in a continuous open world that is the largest map featured in the series to date.[1] It also features a fast travel option for quicker traversal, as well as the option to activate navigation that will mark a line on the ground to follow if players are unsure of how to reach their destination."

It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]  This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.  Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002."

Sunak will become the latest leader of the ruling Conservative Party to enter the revolving door of No. 10 Downing St., following Liz Truss' resignation just 44 days after taking office. Her scandal-plagued predecessor, Boris Johnson, dropped his bid for a  comeback Sunday. In his first public statement after the results were announced, Sunak said the country faces a “profound economic challenge.”  He went on to pledge to work for “stability and unity,” and added that he would make it his “utmost priority” to unite the party and the country. Sunak’s victory was confirmed after his only other challenger, Penny Mordaunt, failed to secure the support of enough of her fellow lawmakers before the deadline. \"Rishi Sunak is therefore elected as leader of the Conservative Party,\" Graham Brady, the Conservative lawmaker who oversees the party's leadership elections, told his colleagues, who banged on tables and cheered at the announcement."

We learned from this that the Academy must be fully transparent and accountable in our actions and particularly in times of crisis.”  \t“We must act swiftly, compassionately and decisively for ourselves and for our industry. You should and can expect no less from us going forward,” she added. “We are committed to maintaining the highest of standards while creating the changes we wish to see in our industry.”  \tDuring Netflix’s first live special Chris Rock: Selective Outrage!"

WATCH: Will Smith slaps Chris Rock onstage after joke at wife Jada Pinkett Smith's expense   The moment shocked the Dolby Theatre audience and viewers at home. Smith later took the stage when he won best actor for Venus and Serena Williams' father in \"King Richard,\" his first Oscar. His acceptance speech vacillated between defense and apology. \"Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family,\" Smith said in his first remarks. Smith then shared what Denzel Washington told him: \"At your highest moment, be careful because that's when the devil comes for you.\"  Aside from what seemed likely to be one of the most infamous moments in Academy Awards history, other wins made history of their own. Ariana DeBose became the first Afro-Latina and openly LBGTQ actor to win an Academy Award for supporting actress. Campion also became only the third woman to win best director for \"The Power of the Dog.\" She had been the first woman ever twice nominated in the category (previously for 1993's \"The Piano\"). It's also the first time the directing award has ever gone to women in back-to-back years, after \"Nomadland\" filmmaker Chloé Zhao won last year."

You get 30W wired charging for the Pixel Fold, which is the same as the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. And the Pixel Fold supports Qi wireless charging.   The Pixel Fold certainly seems like a promising entry into the foldable phones market. It offers a durable and flexible hinge, a front display that looks easy to use and a premium camera experience in the thinnest foldable design yet.  It's also encouraging to see Google optimizing its own apps for foldables and pushing developers to do the same. However, the $1,799 price will give anyone pause because Google is known for undercutting Samsung and other flagships. So far after testing the Pixel Fold, it's proving more to be a champ among foldables and should be in consideration for the best phones this year.

With this year's developer conference now out of the way, the cat is finally out of the bag, and we will soon be able to get our hands on Google's first foldable. We can only hope that this brings more foldables from other manufactures to the US, as more competition is always better. Keep your eyes peeled on June 27th if you're looking to pick one up at launch.

One is in stable condition at Hackensack Medical Center. The other, who immigrated from Dominican Republic four months ago, lost her life.  \"She was a beautiful person. She came over here to have a better life. She was a very joyful person,\" Paulino said.  Parkway police said the van shuttled workers back and forth from their homes to a party goods supply factory in upstate New York. Most victims live in Upper Manhattan, where the van was heading.  Family members said no one from the New York-based employment agency told them about the accident, leaving loved ones to frantically rush to the scene near Englewood Cliffs to learn details.  \"This bus always has a problem. They're supposed to get home at 11. Sometimes they get home at four in the morning because the bus runs out of gas or it gets lost or something. It's always something with the bus,\" said Paulino.  Relatives went to the temp agency On Target in Inwood to demand answers, but got nothing. Paulino wasn't the only one left in limbo.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War.  The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise."

Bantering with Twitter followers late last year, Musk expressed pessimism about the prospects for a new CEO, saying that person “must like pain a lot” to run a company that “has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy.” “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Undated photo of Leonard Francis “We are following leads that have come into our national number, as well as our website, and we are following some leads that we have established ourselves,” he said. “As of now, we think he’s probably going international. It sounds like he’s been planning this for a while.” Castillo said he didn’t know what security arrangements were in place at Francis’ residence. He understands that Francis had security monitoring him, issued by the court, but paid for by Francis. “I can tell you nobody was there when we showed up,” he said. “Nobody was there.” It’s unclear how much time Francis had spent detained in U.S. physical custody before or after his conviction on a guilty plea. He had been living in home detention for at least four years, according to unsealed court documents. That arrangement, approved by Sammartino with prosecutors’ support, was based on round-the-clock monitoring by a GPS ankle bracelet and a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week physical guard at Francis’ residence."

Woods made the cut and finished the tournament 47th, visibly limping for much of the last two rounds. Defending champion Hideki Matsuyama finished tied for 14th.[6]  There was no winner of the Silver Cup (prize for low amateur), as no amateur made the cut.

For a moment there earlier in the night, it looked like the more traditional All Quiet on the Western Front might give the inventive Everything Everywhere All at Once a run for the money. But in the end, the latter took home seven titles to All Quiet's four — if that's not a sweep, we're not sure what is.

She became the youngest major finalist since Sharapova at the 2004 Wimbledon Championships, and the youngest French Open finalist since Kim Clijsters in 2001.[12]  This was the first edition of the tournament to feature a final set tiebreak.[13] When the score in a final set reached 6–6, the first player to reach 10 points and lead by at least two points won the set (and the match).

However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children’s actions. RELATED: 5 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.  If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming, making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas."

The channel's most successful comedy since Father Ted, the series was inspired by McGee's own experiences growing up in Derry, Northern Ireland, in the 1990s, during the final years of the Troubles.[5] It stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Louisa Harland, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, and Dylan Llewellyn as five teenagers living in mid-1990s Derry while attending Our Lady Immaculate College, a fictional girls' Catholic secondary school based on the real-life Thornhill College, where McGee herself studied.[6][7] Produced by British production company Hat Trick Productions, Derry Girls is filmed in Northern Ireland, with most scenes shot on location in Derry and some in Belfast.  Although the plot lines of Derry Girls are fictional, the series frequently references actual events of the Troubles and the Northern Ireland peace process, including the 1994 IRA ceasefire announcement, the 1995 visit to Northern Ireland of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and the Good Friday referendum of 1998."

GPT-3 was announced in May 2020, almost two years ago. It was released one year after GPT-2 — which was also released a year after the original GPT paper was published. If this trend were to hold across versions, GPT-4 should already be here. It’s not, but OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, said a few months ago that GPT-4 is coming. Current estimates forecast the release date sometime in 2022, likely around July-August. Despite being one of the most awaited AI news, there’s little public info about GPT-4: what it’ll be like, its features, or its abilities. Altman conducted a Q&A last year and gave a few hints on OpenAI’s ideas for GPT-4 (he asked participants to be discrete about the info, and I’ve been silent — but seven months is a reasonable time margin). One thing he said for sure is that GPT-4 won’t have 100T parameters, as I hypothesized in a previous article (such a big model will have to wait). It’s been some time since OpenAI revealed any info on GPT-4."

While the video part was not said to be a component of GPT-4, what was of interest and possibly related, is that Altman was emphatic that OpenAI would not release GPT-4 until they were assured that it was safe. The relevant part of the interview occurs at the 4:37 minute mark: The interviewer asked: “Can you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?” Sam Altman responded: “It’ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it much  longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach to this. But at the time I realized like people want the shiny toy and it’s frustrating and I totally get that.” Twitter is abuzz with rumors that are difficult to confirm. One unconfirmed rumor is that it will have 100 trillion parameters (compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion parameters)."

Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India. And it has done it with Apple,\" Mr Roy says."

More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren’t helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself — and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail. “I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly — who does that?” Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. “I don’t see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future.” India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India’s, has two. But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India’s. In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company’s market share in India has been growing rapidly."

It was held at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France, from 22 May to 5 June 2022, comprising singles, doubles and mixed doubles play. Junior and wheelchair tournaments are also scheduled. Novak Djokovic was the defending champion in men's singles, and Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion in the women's singles.[1] Neither successfully defended their title, with Djokovic losing in the quarter-finals to Rafael Nadal, and Krejčíková losing in the first round to Diane Parry.  The event returned to its full spectator capacity after the last two editions due to COVID-19 restrictions in France. It was the 126th edition of the French Open and the second Grand Slam event of 2022. The main singles draws included 16 qualifiers for men and 16 for women out of 128 players in each draw. It was part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour. It was also the first edition of the tournament to feature a super tie break in the final set where the player would win first to ten points as rules are now applied in Wimbledon and US Open.[2]"

It’s been a while. In recent history, a 4-foot-8 cloud has cast a shadow over the competition. As long as Simone Biles was competing — and her peers readily admitted this — everyone else knew they were going for second place. At least in the all-around. But really, Biles’ combination of difficulty and execution was so high that she was all but a lock to win vault, and in most years floor and beam, too. Heck, she even won a national title on bars in 2018. With the most decorated gymnast of all time having stepped away from the sport following the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, the 20 women competing at this year’s nationals in Tampa, Florida, find themselves in a unique position. Not only has Biles’ absence opened up the race for national titles, but the competition is also wide open. The women’s event takes place Friday and Sunday nights at Amalie Arena, with scores from both competitions being combined to determine the national champions."

Sunak will become the latest leader of the ruling Conservative Party to enter the revolving door of No. 10 Downing St., following Liz Truss' resignation just 44 days after taking office. Her scandal-plagued predecessor, Boris Johnson, dropped his bid for a  comeback Sunday. In his first public statement after the results were announced, Sunak said the country faces a “profound economic challenge.”  He went on to pledge to work for “stability and unity,” and added that he would make it his “utmost priority” to unite the party and the country. Sunak’s victory was confirmed after his only other challenger, Penny Mordaunt, failed to secure the support of enough of her fellow lawmakers before the deadline. \"Rishi Sunak is therefore elected as leader of the Conservative Party,\" Graham Brady, the Conservative lawmaker who oversees the party's leadership elections, told his colleagues, who banged on tables and cheered at the announcement."

The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.[4] For instance, Stephen Brook in The Guardian newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that \"what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear\".[4] During the Doctor's latest incarnations, his primary companions, such as Rose Tyler and Martha Jones, have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series—including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation. In the first two series of the renewed programme, the only supporting actor to receive a title credit is Billie Piper, although short-term companions Bruno Langley (Adam Mitchell), John Barrowman (Jack Harkness) and Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith) all appear."

But the future of Who is looking a bit simpler. In fact, with the casting of Gibson, it almost seems like Doctor Who 2024 will be a soft reboot. Although the number of regular companions in the TARDIS has varied over the nearly 60-year-long history of Doctor Who (and the show began with three companions on the TARDIS) contemporary fans tend to think of the series as a series that stars two people; the Doctor, and the companion. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper kicked off the new era of Who in 2005, which was followed by David Tennant and Billie Piper in 2006. Following that it was Tennant and Freema Agyeman for Season 3, Tennant and Catherine Tate for Season 4, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan for Season 5, Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman for Season 7, Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman for Seasons 8 and 9, and then Capaldi and Pearl Mackie for Season 10.

It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]  This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.  Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002."

After starting the season 16–19 and in 10th place in the Eastern Conference standings, the Celtics finished the regular season with a record of 51–31, winning 35 of their final 47 games to finish with the second-best record in the conference.[10]"

                "node_text": "Scream VI is a 2023 American slasher film directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, and written by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick. It is the sequel to Scream (2022) and the sixth installment in the Scream film series. The film stars Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Mason Gooding, Hayden Panettiere, and Courteney Cox, all reprising their roles from previous installments, with Josh Segarra, Jack Champion, Devyn Nekoda, Liana Liberato, Tony Revolori, Samara Weaving, Henry Czerny, and Dermot Mulroney joining the ensemble cast. The plot follows a new Ghostface killer, who begins targeting the survivors of the \"Woodsboro legacy murders\" in New York City.  A sixth Scream film was announced just weeks after the successful debut of Scream (2022), with much of the cast signing on to reprise their roles alongside Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett's return. Filming took place in Montreal, Canada, from June to late August 2022. Neve Campbell did not reprise her role as Sidney Prescott due to a pay dispute, making this the first Scream film not to feature her. Brian Tyler composed the film's score, with Sven Faulconer co-scoring."

If you look at the RTX 4080 alone, regardless of the price, it is a really good graphics card. It outperforms every GPU from the previous generation, including the RTX 3090 Ti, by a considerable amount. The sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what gamers truly think. It’s also around 30% slower than the RTX 4090 while only being 25% cheaper, and this is where things get complicated, because, at MSRP, the RTX 4090 is a much better deal than the 4080 — even if it’s more expensive. It offers much better performance per dollar, which historically hasn’t been the case. The flagships were aimed at enthusiasts who didn’t try to get the best deal; they just wanted the best performance. Take one step down from the top and the good deals start, where the performance is still great but the price is less ridiculous. That hasn’t been true in this generation, and the sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what Nvidia’s customers think about this. Every time a new GPU drops, scalpers can be counted on to buy it en masse and then throw it up on eBay at a huge markup."

                "node_text": "In short — the RTX 4080 seems to have done the 4090 a favor. It made an overpriced GPU suddenly appear much more desirable than it ever should have been. Now, the question is, was this Nvidia’s plan all along, or did it simply overestimate the enthusiasm people would have for the 4080? Considering the fact that Nvidia is planning to strategically cut the MSRP of the RTX 4080 soon, it might be that it never intended for the 4080 to serve as a crutch for the sales of the 4090. Nvidia also has some serious competition on the horizon. AMD will soon be launching the next-gen Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, both of which are supposed to rival the RTX 4080, but at more reasonable prices — $999 and $899, respectively. With the upcoming price cut, the RTX 4080 might become a more worthwhile contender. For now, if you manage to spot the 4090 for $1,600, it is a better deal — but only if you can make use of it. If you’re a casual gamer, save your money and get the 4080 without worrying about benchmarks and comparisons. Personally, I’m still waiting for the 7900 XTX, and judging by the performance per dollar of the RTX 4080, I really have no regrets."

Novak Djokovic was the defending champion in men's singles, and Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion in the women's singles.[1] Neither successfully defended their title, with Djokovic losing in the quarter-finals to Rafael Nadal, and Krejčíková losing in the first round to Diane Parry.  The event returned to its full spectator capacity after the last two editions due to COVID-19 restrictions in France. It was the 126th edition of the French Open and the second Grand Slam event of 2022. The main singles draws included 16 qualifiers for men and 16 for women out of 128 players in each draw. It was part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour. It was also the first edition of the tournament to feature a super tie break in the final set where the player would win first to ten points as rules are now applied in Wimbledon and US Open.[2]"

Google showcased the Pixel Tablet last year at I/O 2022, and then again during the Pixel launch event in October. There aren't many surprises left, but we should finally find out the price and launch date. For context, the device is not meant to compete with the Galaxy Tab series but will instead be targeted at those looking for a basic tablet to keep at home for everyday use. I/O 2023 will also give us better insights into all the new bells and whistles of Android 14, especially new privacy and security features. We're not expecting Android 14 to be a major update by any means, but we did see some minor but nifty features in the Android 14 Beta 1. Google released its debut smartwatch, the Pixel Watch, at I/O last year... and it's not great. The device suffers from poor battery life, a small screen, huge bezels, and has some features locked behind a subscription paywall. All that's on top of the hefty $350 price tag. Suffice to say, we're expecting the Pixel Watch 2 to be better in every way. The Pixel 7a, Pixel Fold, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Tablet will be among the many things Google will talk about at I/O 2023."

Update, August 7, 2023 (10:49 AM ET): We’ve updated the Google Pixel Watch 2 rumor hub with information on the specs, model numbers, and design. Original article: After years of rumors and speculation, the Google Pixel Watch hit wrists to mixed reviews. Some details, like unique Fitbit integration and a minimalist design, knocked it out of the park. Others, like disappointing battery life, rang up short. Now just months later, we’re already looking ahead to the next season of potentially exciting wearable launches. Most importantly, we’re eager to see Google drop a second generation of its very first smartwatch to see if it can polish up the rough edges. Stay tuned to hear everything we know about the Google Pixel Watch 2 and find out what features we are most hopeful to see for the search giant’s next attempt. Ever since the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 series, the Wear OS landscape has been an exciting market to watch. Samsung kept its foot on the gas with the Galaxy Watch 5, and other companies, such as Fossil, have scrambled to keep up. When the first Pixel Watch finally landed in the fray, we accepted Google’s smartwatch as an imperfect but promising first attempt."

Despite the difficulties with the pandemic, which halted production on Season 33 from February 2020 until September 2021, a renewal was always in the offing. Keoghan told Gold Derby in June 2021 that “the expectation from the network is that we get Season 33 finished and then we roll into more seasons again.” In December, while Omicron was surging, co-creator and executive producer Bertram van Munster said it was a “waiting game right now” in regards to future seasons. “We’re being very, very careful.” What will Season 34 look like?"

The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix Stadium).[6]  Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV.  After the Eagles went into halftime up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but supported by others.",

The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas City Chiefs  defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35. The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix Stadium).[6]  Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV.  After the Eagles went into halftime up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but supported by others."

The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20. The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII."

Patrick Mahomes and the elite offense of the Chiefs’ were stymied by the Bucs’ defense, recording zero touchdowns in the big game.  Meanwhile, Brady grabbed his seventh Super Bowl ring by throwing for 201 yards and three touchdowns. He connected with Rob Gronkowski six times for 67 yards and two touchdowns.  Super Bowl LVII is set to take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., home of the Arizona Cardinals. It will be the fourth Super Bowl hosted in the Phoenix metropolitan area, with the last one coming in 2015 for Super Bowl XLIX.  The 2024 and 2025 Super Bowls are also set.

For the second straight year, we had a truly exciting game, in which the Cardinals rallied from being down 20-7 to take a 23-20 lead, only to have Ben Roethlisberger come through in the clutch, capped off by a stunning TD catch by Santonio Holmes, who won the game MVP. After years of bad mis-matches, the Super Bowl has once again become a game worth watching in its entirety. Super Bowl XLIV--New Orleans 31, Indianapolis 17--This was the first meeting of #1 seeds in the Super Bowl since 1993, and both teams got off to blistering regular season starts--the Colts 14-0 before losing their last two, and the Saints 13-0 before losing their last three games. But both dominated in the postseason until meeting in Miami. The Colts were favored, but they hadn't faced an offense quite like New Orleans'. And though the Colts jumped out to a 10-0 lead, Drew Brees methodically picked the Colts' defense apart, and Sean Payton gambled and won with an onside kick to start the second half. Of course, Tracy Porter's pick six of Peyton Manning late in the fourth quarter was the clincher. Super Bowl LVII: Kansas City Chiefs 38, Philadelphia Eagles 35."

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie. Just Call Out My Name opens with clips of late-night talk show hosts (Leno, Carson, Letterman) introducing Taylor or King or both, then a blip of Oprah praising Taylor, but what she thinks of King, NOBODY KNOWS."

A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second television series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season."

But if you stayed past the credits to catch a preview of episode 6, you might have felt a bit confused.

The preview starts with a dragon flying, and then a member of the king's Small Council saying, \"We should address the latest development in the Stepstones.\" Wait, didn't Prince Daemon already handily do that by cutting the Crabfeeder in half? Ohhh, wait, this isn't a rerun. The Stepstones are giving Viserys ulcers once again.  Queen Alicent, now played by Olivia Cooke, age 28, instead of Emily Carey, 19, helpfully tells us it's been a decade since Daemon fought that battle, and he's since left the region undefended."

It’ll cost $69.99, the first first-party Nintendo Switch game to carry that higher-than-normal price. A $129.99 collector’s edition will be available on that day, too. It includes a physical copy of Tears of the Kingdom, an art book, SteelBook case, an Iconart steel poster, and four pins. When Breath of the Wild was released in 2017, it launched on Nintendo Switch as a launch title as well as Wii U. Tears of the Kingdom will only be released on Nintendo Switch. We put together a whole guide on where you can pre-order Tears of the Kingdom, whether you want the base version or the pricier collector’s edition. Check that out for the full details, but here are a few links if you just want to pre-order now. There are several different pre-order bonuses, too, most different across country lines.                Prices taken at time of publishing.              Still haven’t gotten a copy of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? You’re missing out on a fantastic title, complete with a gripping story and goofy physics. Yes, although we have a suspicion that Nintendo hasn’t shared all of the details on amiibo Tears of the Kingdom compatibility."

Whereas Zelda: Breath of the Wild was released across the Wii U and Switch, Tears of the Kingdom is only available on Switch. How long is Zelda Tears of the Kingdom?  That question is essentially as easy to answer as 'how long is a piece of string?' Tears of the Kingdom is a massive game if you want it to be, whereas the current speedrun time is only 92 minutes. You can now read our full The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review or watch the video chat above. We've given the game 4.5 stars out of 5, and call the sequel \"a rich, robust experience that builds on what came before\" with Nintendo proving that it is indeed possible to expand one of the biggest and most popular games available on the Switch. With its fantastic new abilities, stunning overworld, and fantastic approach to exploration and boss design, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a truly unmissable experience.   Nintendo resisted revealing the name of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for fear of the subtitle spoiling too much of the story. Naturally, this has gotten the gears in our brains turning."

See our ethics statement.      In 2023, Polygon is embarking on a Zeldathon. Join us on our journey through The Legend of Zelda series, from the original 1986 game to the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and beyond.    The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ends with Link and Zelda vowing to restore Hyrule’s majesty — bringing it “even beyond” what it originally was, Zelda says, even though her power is diminished. Though The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been described as a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, Nintendo’s been quite secretive about where and how the story picks up. Nintendo even kept Tears of the Kingdom’s name secret for years, revealing it only in 2022 because the company said its reveal might “give away too much.” In the time since Nintendo’s Tears of the Kingdom announcement, the company has strategically released new information through a series of trailers. In analyzing those trailers, there is some information we can glean about the game ahead of its release date. As we approach the May release date, Nintendo’s dropping more and more details, including a 10 minutes gameplay demo. Here’s what you should know."

The original Overwatch was released over three years ago, and while Blizzard has continued to expand the game with new heroes, maps, and game modes, it hasn’t gotten a major update like this in the lifetime of the game.  By adding an actual story mode, the sequel will look to expand on the lore that Blizzard has slowly been building for the Overwatch universe over the past few years with in-game content and elaborate cinematic shorts. The Overwatch 2 announcement movie picks up after the variety of short films that Blizzard has released so far, seeing the heroes of Overwatch facing off against Null Sector — an invading robot force. Unlike the original game, which was primarily a PvP multiplayer experience, the sequel appears to be emphasizing cooperative PvE content that will see players face off against a multitude of computer enemies in both story levels and more replayable “hero missions.” Players will also be able to level up their heroes and customize their abilities, in another first for the franchise.  There are still PvP modes and maps, too, with Blizzard promising a new core “Push” mode as well as new maps and heroes (who’ll be added alongside the existing 31 heroes that are already returning). The game will also still heavily feature six-versus-six team combat, similar to the previous game."

                "node_text": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild[b] is a 2017 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U. Set at the end of the Zelda timeline, the player controls an amnesiac Link as he sets out to save Princess Zelda and prevent Calamity Ganon from destroying the world. Players explore the open world of Hyrule while they collect items and complete objectives such as puzzles or side quests. Breath of the Wild's world is unstructured and encourages exploration and experimentation; the story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.  Development lasted five years, commencing immediately after the release of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword in 2011. Led by director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and producer Eiji Aonuma, Nintendo sought to rethink Zelda's conventions and introduced elements such as detailed chemistry and physics engines. The designers drew inspiration from Shadow of the Colossus (2005) and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011). Monolith Soft, known for their work on the open-world Xenoblade Chronicles series, assisted in designing landscapes and topography.  Breath of the Wild was first planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive. It was eventually released on March 3, 2017, as a launch game for the Switch and the final Nintendo game for the Wii U. It received widespread acclaim and won numerous Game of the Year accolades."

Ever since Nintendo announced its sequel to 2017’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, several titles for the upcoming RPG have been leaked; however so far none have gone on to show even a glimmer of accuracy. Nintendo first announced that a sequel to Breath of the Wild was in development all the way back in 2019 at an E3 Nintendo Direct presentation. During this presentation, fans were treated to a dark and mysterious trailer that showed Link and Princess Zelda as they travelled through a murky underground dungeon to the corpse of Ganondorf. The corpse soon reanimates itself and grabs the Hero of Time as waves of ghostly light are emitted all around them. Since that particular Breath of the Wild 2 announcement, fans have heard no more about it from Nintendo. Instead, Nintendo revealed Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity out of the blue in September 2020, with the Dynasty Warriors-spin off releasing shortly after in November. The news of Age of Calamity made it the first time in the Zelda franchise’s history that both a prequel and sequel for one game were in production at the same time."

For now, the film’s release date is July 21, 2023. The film has landed another heavy hitter for its male lead. Blue Valentine actor Ryan Gosling is in final negotiations to play Barbie’s beau Ken, per Deadline. The Academy Award nominee has apparently been the studio’s only choice from the beginning, and he has now signed on after finding an opening in his schedule. With Gosling signing on, it looks like the long-awaited project can start filming in early 2022. Several cast announcements have been rolling out in the past few weeks, with major stars joining Robbie and Gosling in the upcoming film. One surprising casting, Sex Education star Emma Mackey, has drawn attention since she and Robbie look so similar. While no details from the plot have been released, the castings add more allure to Gerwig’s take on the Mattel doll’s story."

In April, Warner Bros. debuted a handful of character posters, which gave more insight into who everyone from the cast was playing. The studio also released the official poster for the film, which features Robbie and Gosling on the iconic Barbie logo.   The first teaser trailer for the Barbie movie dropped on Dec. 16, 2022. The 74-second clip opens with little girls playing with baby dolls in a rugged setting.   \"Since the beginning of time, since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls,\" the narrator can be heard saying. \"But the dolls were always and forever baby dolls. Until ...\"   The camera then cuts to Robbie towering over the girls in a black-and-white striped bathing suit, black heels and white sunglasses. In awe of Barbie, the girls decide to smash their baby dolls.   Viewers then get a brief look at the playful and colorful world of Barbie.

By Sandra Newman A HOUSE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE MOONBy Rebecca Scherm Rebecca Scherm’s second novel, “A House Between the Earth and the Moon,” centers on Parallaxis, a space station designed by the tech corporation Sensus as an orbital luxury condo for billionaires. Sensus has hired a team of world-class scientists to construct the station and make it habitable long-term. In return, they are told, they and their families can live there, safe from the catastrophic climate change that is devastating society below. They are not told they will also be experimental subjects; Sensus is using the station to test Views, its new, top-secret surveillance and behavioral modification system. The novel makes us feel the terror of a 2030s Earth where extreme weather events are so common that whole cities routinely burn to the ground and even the affluent have become nomadic, always one step ahead of natural disasters. Mass deaths are a staple of daily news, and privacy is a thing of the past, available only by going off the grid and doing without the evacuation alerts that would warn of approaching floods or wildfires. We share the desperation of Alex, whose work on carbon-extracting algae has become a race against time: “He wanted to save his planet, and with each disastrous year, his work became more necessary and less possible."

I agree with Adam that efficiency seems to be a big area of improvement, and I also believe that NIL and say, Oklahoma's and Texas's move to the SEC for example, are just the tip of the iceberg. We're only a few degrees away from a proposed super league and players making pro-level money either by way of endorsements or other sources. Even if an NCAA president wouldn't exactly welcome such changes, having someone who could work in tandem with conference commissioners, school presidents and athletes to provide structure to those shifts would go a long way toward turning this organization from a dinosaur into an active participant in the evolution of college sports. Voepel: While not being naive about the fact that college sports are big business, I hope the next president is much more in touch with actual student-athletes and what they want and need. Student-athletes are more powerful than ever because of NIL opportunities and the transfer portal. But they also seem more troubled than ever by stress/mental health concerns. And if some of the tragedies we have seen in recent years in that regard don't seriously alarm the NCAA, they should. On top of everything else the new president has to navigate, concern for and communication with student-athletes needs to be a bigger priority."

                "node_text": "Isn't this whole thing supposed to be for and about them? ESPN spoke to both a school president and athletic director on Tuesday who reiterated one of this obvious legacies from Emmert's tenure -- being the NCAA president is not a coveted job. Emmert himself entered the role with ambition and big ideas, only to end up spending the majority of his final years taking bullets for college presidents and flubbing seemingly every public appearance. Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck. They both know how thankless the job is, but they also still are true believers in college athletics. A popular internal option would be Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's senior vice president of basketball who is the association's most respected employee. The NCAA could also continue to go the route of college presidents, which has been the prior model the past two full-time presidents -- Myles Brand and Emmert. Washington State's Kirk Schultz, Baylor's Linda Livingstone and Clemson's Jim Clements are a few of more prominent presidents in the athletics realm."

Why? Because she's turning a moment that was supposed to be about her legacy, into a moment about her tennis. She set the stage for this special Open by writing last month that likely it would be her last. New York responded as only New York could, feting her with video tributes by Queen Latifah and Oprah Winfrey.

Here in the U.S., however, it was Mayyas — a modern dance collective comprising 36 Lebanese women of varying ages, and the first Arab dance crew to ever appear on AGT — that ultimately won AGT’s $1 million prize and a headlining slot at the Luxor Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Kristy placed second, and the top five was rounded out by country music acts Chapel Hart and Drake Milligan (fifth and third place, respectively) and deepfake technology artists MetaPhysic in fourth. Viewers were thrilled with this result, taking to Twitter with comments like: “After 17 seasons, the curse has finally ended and a dance group won #AGT!” (The only time a dance collective had ever won the show was when India’s V.Unbeatable, who’d previously placed fourth on AGT Season 14, prevailed on the all-star spinoff AGT: The Champions in 2020.",

The Voice's season 23 finale aired live on Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST on NBC."

Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which repair you’re making, but there’s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for 7 days once you’ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged “a fee and a tax” via a hold on your credit card.

                "node_text": "For the review, Barbera first explained that he is not a skilled repairman and purchased parts for a battery replacement for his iPhone 12 mini, along with the tool kit. After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.  Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits. As an average consumer, Barbera described the process as difficult and mentioned several times that he feared he’d punctured the battery, which can be extremely dangerous and even result in a house fire.  “Apple does a great job of quickly sending you everything for this and labeling and organizing things, but ultimately it comes down to how well you can follow the instructions, how much patience you have and whether or not you really want to risk your phone of further damage if you mess something up."

The thing you should understand about Apple’s home repair process is that it’s a far cry from traditional DIY if you opt for the kit — which I did, once I saw the repair manual only contains instructions for Apple’s own tools. (You can just buy a battery if you want.) I expected Apple would send me a small box of screwdrivers, spudgers, and pliers; I own a mini iPhone, after all. Instead, I found two giant Pelican cases — 79 pounds of tools — on my front porch. I couldn’t believe just how big and heavy they were considering Apple’s paying to ship them both ways. I lugged those cases onto a BART train to San Francisco and dragged them down the streets to our office. Then, I set everything out on a table and got started. Step one of opening an iPhone is, basically, using a hefty machine to suck the screen off the top. Here, I wasn’t microwaving a jelly-filled sock to loosen the Apple goop holding my screen down! Apple lets you rent an industrial-grade heat station that looks like a piece of lab equipment, right down to the big red safety dial you twist to release the emergency-off button and the suction-cup-tipped mechanical lifting arm. It looks pretty cool."

Cameroon became the first African side to make the last eight in Italy in 1990. They stunned defending champions Argentina in the tournament’s opening game at the San Siro and that momentum saw them go on and top a group also containing Romania and the Soviet Union. They then beat Colombia 2-1 in extra time in the round of 16, with a 38-year-old Milla scoring a brace to sink the South Americans. With the continent in dreamland, the Indomitable Lions took on England in the quarter-finals. David Platt scored for England in the first half, before Emmanuel Kunde equalised from the spot in the 61st minute. Four minutes later Eugene Ekeke gave Cameroon the lead and the world was 25 minutes from a first African semi-finalist. However, Gary Lineker equalised from the penalty spot and then won it in extra time with another penalty. Cameroon were out but had taken a continent on the journey of a lifetime. Advertisement Senegal followed in Cameroon’s footsteps in 2002 in South Korea and Japan — in more ways than one. They beat the defending champions (France) in the tournament’s opening game on their way to qualifying for the knockout stages."

All times are South Africa Standard Time (UTC+2).  The tournament match schedule was announced in November 2007.[73][74] In the first round, or group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.  The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.  Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]  Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986."

There has been an unmistakable glass ceiling over Africa at football World Cups. In reaching the quarter-finals in the 1990 World Cup, Cameroon set a benchmark that has not been bettered yet. Senegal and Ghana also reached the last-eight, in 2002 and 2010 respectively, but the continent’s tale of the tape on the global stage has been one of relative underachievement. Powered by Roger Milla’s swivelling hips and a fearless athleticism, Cameroon’s Indomitable Lions were the shining light of the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Wins over holders Argentina, Romania and Colombia set the bar high and, for the first time, an African side claimed three wins at a World Cup. That performance was widely expected to herald a new age of achievement. It also seemed to justify Pele’s assertion that an African team would win the World Cup by 2000. However, that prediction would ultimately fall short. But in 2002, Senegal staked claims for the big prize. Amid a hail of falling seeds early on, the team set out its stall by beating reigning champions France and becoming the first African team to go through a World Cup group stage undefeated. They were ultimately undone by fatigue and a golden goal, but that success launched the mainstream appeal of Senegalese football."

Prime Day, which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon’s 20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional business for Amazon — and the retailer’s marketplace sellers — before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than 20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon’s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13. That’s up 8.1% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2021, which ran from June 21 through 22. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon’s 2020 event.   Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus pandemic."

                "node_text": "Windows 11 is a major release of the Windows NT developed by Microsoft that was released in October 2021. Starting with Windows 10, Microsoft described Windows as an \"operating system as a service\" that would receive ongoing updates to its features and functionality, augmented with the ability for enterprise environments to receive non-critical updates at a slower pace or use long-term support milestones that will only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their five-year lifespan of mainstream support.  Windows Insider Preview builds are delivered to Insiders in four different channels. Insiders in the Dev and Canary Channel receive updates prior to those in the Beta Channel, but might experience more bugs and other issues. Insiders in the Release Preview Channel do not receive updates until the version is almost available to the public, but are comparatively more stable.  As with Windows 10 (since version 20H2), mainstream builds of Windows 11 are labeled \"YYHX\", with YY representing the two-digit year and X representing the half-year of planned release (for example, version 21H2 refers to builds which initially released in the second half of 2021).  The original version of Windows 11 (also known as version 21H2 and codenamed \"Sun Valley\") was released in October 2021.[1][2] It carries the build number 10.0.22000."

The Settings app is also getting a bunch of updates. Microsoft is updating several areas of the app to align with the design language. You will find these changes on the “Storage spaces” settings, “Time & language” section, “Focus” page, and in the “Windows Update” section, you will now find a new page to uninstall updates. In a continued effort to keep modernizing the built-in apps and tools, version 22H2 also comes with a redesigned Task Manager that matches the design style available on Windows 11 with rounded corners and mica material that shines the desktop background through the app’s frame and new iconography. However, the app retains the familiar experience as the legacy version but with modern improvements. Microsoft is also updating the “Focus” feature and introducing a new “Do not disturb” feature to silence notification banners.

Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Carlos Alcaraz saved a match point in the fourth set before digging deep in the decider to beat Jannik Sinner in a five-set thriller and reach the U.S. Open semi-finals in the early hours of Thursday in New York. The Spanish teenager collapsed on his back after the match lasting more than five hours concluded at 2:50 a.m., beating the previous record for the latest finish of 2:26 a.m. set in three matches in 1993, 2012 and 2014. The 6-3 6-7(7) 6-7(0) 7-5 6-3 win keeps alive Alcaraz's hopes of winning a maiden Grand Slam title and claiming the world number one ranking. \"Honestly I still don't know how I did it,\" Alcaraz said in an on-court interview. \"The level that I played, the level of the match, the high quality of tennis. \"It's unbelievable."

The Spaniard is widely believed to be the next big thing in men's tennis, and he already has one Grand Slam title to his name as a 20-year-old, winning the 2022 U.S. Open by defeating Ruud. Alcaraz won the U.S. Open when he was just 19 years old, becoming the first male player to win a Grand Slam as a teenager since Nadal accomplished the feat at Roland Garros in 2005. Additionally, Alcaraz has won 10 ATP Tour men's singles titles, which includes the 2022 U.S. Open and four Masters 1000 titles. Two of his Masters 1000 titles came in the Madrid Open, while the others came in the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and the Miami Open. Alcaraz, who turned pro in 2018, is only just getting started, and tennis fans around the globe are in for a treat once he hits his prime.  Back in the French Open final for the second straight year, Ruud should not be taken lightly entering Sunday despite having to go up against one of the greatest players of all time."

Calvert took down a huge score on Dominic Thiem winning the 2019 Indian Wells title at 80-1, among many stunning calls.  In addition, Calvert nailed Casper Ruud making the 2022 French Open final, winning big for anyone who backed him. Sean also hit all three of his picks at plus-money odds in the Wimbledon final, including Novak Djokovic winning three sets to one at +275. Now, Calvert has locked in on the 2022 U.S. Open men's semifinal matchup featuring Tiafoe vs. Alcaraz and revealed his best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them. Alcaraz, the 19-year-old from Spain, is the betting favorite in the match, and he could become the No. 1 player in the world by the end of the week. This is his first grand slam semifinal, and he is the youngest player to reach the US Open semifinal since Pete Sampras in 1990."

The playoffs also returned to its normal April–June schedule for the first time since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in two postponements in 2020 and 2021.  Eight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.  The NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021–22 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.[12]  Each conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding."

After going down 2–1 in the conference finals against the first-seeded Miami Heat led by Jimmy Butler, the Celtics won in seven games, reaching the Finals for the first time since 2010 and for the 22nd time in their history.[12]  This marked the first time a team from the Greater Boston area reached a championship series of the four major North American sports leagues since 2019, when the Boston Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Finals.  After reaching the Finals for five consecutive seasons (2015–2019), the Warriors were struck with injuries for the next two seasons, with Klay Thompson sitting out for the entire 2019–20 and 2020–21 campaigns, and Stephen Curry playing a combined 68 games during that time span.[13] In 2021–22, Golden State began the season winning 18 of their first 20 games."

The Nets will, by season’s end, be the most talented team in the East and will therefore vanquish all challengers come playoff time.  Mahoney: Brooklyn outlasts an improved, more streamlined Milwaukee team to make it out of the East, in part because Irving took leave from his post as a voice for the voiceless, got his shots, and joined the team midseason. The absolute chaos of the West winds up working in the favor of the steadiest team in the conference: the Phoenix Suns, who play with a similar polish but more pop owed to the further development of their young core. Murdock: Lakers-Nets. Assuming everyone’s healthy, these are the two best teams in the league. And, more importantly, it’s what everyone wants. Make it happen, NBA.  Verrier: Nets and Lakers. The 2021 Finals was the first without either KD or LeBron in a decade. I wouldn’t bet on that happening again this year. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went wrong.

Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle."

Fans have been anticipating the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree release date ever since they sat upon the throne and became the Elden Lord. While you could spend hundreds of hours playing Elden Ring, the most hardcore players have spent several months clamouring for an expansion.   As one of the best PC games, the Elden Ring community has been waiting for this eventful day for some time. FromSoftware, the developers behind the RPG game, had an opportunity to reveal the DLC at The Game Awards 2022 when they won the coveted Game of the Year award. Elden Ring also celebrated its first birthday recently, but the devs waited a few days until they revealed they were working on the Elden Ring expansion. Here’s everything you need to know about the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree release date, including what it might be about, and when you can expect to play it.    There currently is no Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree release date. Given the lack of information about the upcoming expansion, we’re expecting the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC to launch in 2024."

The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max have an A16 chip, but Apple did not use the technology in the 14 and 14 Plus.   The A15 has a 6-core CPU with two performance cores and four efficiency cores, along with a 5-core GPU. Apple last year only used the 5-core GPU version of the A15 in the iPhone 13 Pro models, and a 4-core GPU version was in the iPhone 13 and 13 mini, so there are still improvements comparatively.  While CPU performance is about the same between the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, there are some modest improvements to the GPU. Apple is also using an updated internal design that provides better thermal efficiency.  The 16-core Neural Engine in the A15 chip is able to perform up to 15.8 trillion operations per second, and it powers features like Cinematic mode and Smart HDR 4. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature 6GB RAM, up from 4GB in the prior-generation models.  All iPhone 14 models start with 128GB of storage, and the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus can be ordered with up to 512GB storage space."

It has gained an additional core for the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), but is otherwise the same as the one used in the iPhone 13 series. A processor that’s a year old in a brand new phone? Terrible, right? Not really. The iPhone 14 Plus runs smoothly all the time, has all the speed you could want even when playing games — Asphalt 9: Legends plays superbly — and combined with iOS 16. it’s as easy to use as it is to set up when you first open the box. My iPhone 14 Plus mirrors my iPhone 14 Pro, and after a few prompts, I left the phones next to each other and everything was complete after an hour. Picking it up and using it is no different from my “old” phone, and that’s a massive advantage of continued iPhone ownership. The other aspect that makes it easy to own is how it connects and interacts with other Apple devices, whether it’s automatically opening the keyboard to make entering passwords on Apple TV easier, or the fast, reliable long-distance Bluetooth connection with my AirPods Max. It’s wonderfully hassle-free. It’s an almost perfect example of how I want my technology to be: Powerful, versatile, and convenient."

The iPhone 14 Plus can last up to 26 hours and is the highest-rated battery life in an iPhone. Both models have fast charge support, officially rated at 20W. So, plug the iPhone into a 20W charger to get a 50% charge in about 30 minutes. MagSafe accessories and charging are also supported with no change over previous generations. Magnets align products to the center of the iPhone, though some designed with older camera bumps in mind may have trouble attaching to some models. Apple reserved the latest A16 Bionic for the iPhone 14 Pro lineup, leaving the iPhone 14 with the A15 Bionic. This isn't the same processor used by the iPhone 13. Instead, it is the iPhone 13 Pro's version. It has a 6-core CPU with 2 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. The A15 also has a 15-core Neural Engine for improved processing of machine learning algorithms. It has a 5-core GPU, enabling improved processing in some apps and across the system. This updated processor is also why the iPhone 14 gets access to the updated 4K Cinematic Mode. Face ID hasn't been updated and still lives behind the same-sized notch as iPhone 13. However, thanks to iOS 16, users can unlock their iPhone 14 in portrait or landscape orientation."

We previously took a look at the technical readout of the iPhone 14 Pro, offering us a chance to look at the camera hardware changes. Our key takeaway was that there are indeed some major changes, even if just on paper. The rear camera bump is almost all-new: the iPhone 14 Pro gains larger sensors in its ultra-wide and main (wide) cameras, but Apple also promises leaps in image quality through improved software processing and special silicon. However, what caught everyone’s eye first was the opener of Apple’s presentation of iPhone 14 Pro: a striking visual change. The iPhone’s recognizable screen cutout or ‘notch’ had all but disappeared, tucking its camera and sensor hardware into a small yet dynamic ‘island’. The user interface adapts around it; growing and shrinking with the screen cutout in an absolute feat of design. What’s more impressive to us, however, was miniaturizing the complex and large array of sensors and camera needed for Face ID. While the large cameras protruding ever-further from the rear of our iPhones capture our attention first — and will certainly get the most attention in this review, as well — the front-facing camera in the iPhone 14 Pro saw one of the biggest upgrades in recent memory, with its sensor, lens and software processing seeing a significant overhaul."

First, there will be no mega mentor, and the coaches will work directly with their teams to prepare for the challenge. In addition, the round will be a \"three-way knockout,\" making the competition more fiercer than ever before.   We can't wait to watch it all go down!

Adrianna Tomaz was born in Kahndaq at the time the country was under military occupation by foreign forces.

He paired it with a Schlumberger single daisy brooch. First Lady Jill Biden's outfit kept to her classic style: she wore a teal wool crepe coat and a blue silk chiffon dress designed by Reem Acra.  The official social media accounts for President Biden and Dr. Biden tweeted, \"Congratulations Naomi and Peter! We love you.\" Congratulations Naomi and Peter! We love you. pic.twitter."

After exchanging their vows, the couple posed for photographs on the White House’s South Portico with Biden’s tremendous veil floating like a sail in the wind. Stylist Bailey Moon has been canvasing designer showrooms and connecting with a multitude of resources to coordinate a cornucopia of options for the wedding, reception and a few pre- and post-events, according to industry sources. The president’s eldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden’s parents are Hunter and Kathleen Buhle, who divorced in 2017.  \tBefore Saturday’s main event, Moon did not acknowledge media requests, neither did event planner Bryan Rafanelli nor photographer John Dolan. Ditto for representatives from Prabal Gurung, Badgley Mischka and a few other designers that were said to be in the mix dressing guests. Rafanelli handled Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in 2010 and his portfolio includes state dinners under President Barack Obama’s administration."

The first lady beams when she takes in Naomi; she’s only seen the dress in sketches, and lace from her own wedding dress is stitched into the bodice. “Oh, honey!” she coos, arms outstretched. (Asked about her favorite memories of her own wedding, Dr. Biden recalled how “spontaneously Beau and Hunter, little boys at the time, stood at the altar with me and Joe.”) The pair sit together on the mint striped-silk sofa. The first lady’s dress is structured with a built-in corset, but Dr. Biden assures the crew she’s perfectly comfortable and can do whatever is needed. “I can move, but I don’t know if my dress will,” she says with a laugh when Vogue’s photographer, Norman Jean Roy, asks her to turn toward Naomi.

Only once in the past four years has Virginia Tech cracked the top 40 in yards per play allowed (36th in 2019), with frightening drop-offs in the other years (115th in 2018, 95th in 2020 and 92nd in 2021).

The official announcements typically lag behind the calendar by a month or two. The information displayed is raw data, not seasonally adjusted. To convert prices while accounting for inflation, use our inflation calculator. You can also view inflation for specific goods & services or Consumer Price Index by year. This graph of historical inflation rates is generated using the average yearly value of inflation since 1913, as reported by the U.S. government Bureau of Labor Statistics. Inflation is the rate of change of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The years with the largest changes in pricing were 1917 (15.12%), 1918 (14.78%), and 1920 (13.51%). This table shows the inflation rate on a monthly basis. The monthly and annual inflation rates are determined by computing the rate of change in Consumer Price Index over a trailing 12-month period. Below are the raw CPI values for each month. To compute inflation, start with the inflation rate formula:CPI in Y2 CPI in Y1 * Y1 USD value = Y2 USD value For example, if you wanted to convert dollar amounts in the year 2000 to dollar amounts in the year 2018:CPI in 2018 CPI in 2000 * 2000 USD value = 2018 USD valueNext, we plug in historical CPI values.

Additionally, U.S. men’s national team general manager Brian McBride is moving on after three years in his role. Here’s what you need to know: U.S. Soccer hired Stewart in 2018 as the USMNT’s first general manager, and he led the hiring search that resulted in Berhalter becoming the national team’s coach. Once Stewart was promoted to sporting director, he helped hire McBride to take over as GM. The departures of Stewart and McBride leave the USMNT with a completely blank slate. The USMNT now has no head coach, no general manager and no sporting director overseeing the program.

What U.S. Soccer is looking for in its next sporting director, he said, is a \"pro at identifying, attracting, retaining and making successful elite-level sporting talent, and someone who can own our technical vision.\" And while that description is vague, and seems less influential than sporting director roles at clubs — where executives can sign and sell players, and actually shape the team on the field immediately — it will be more refined that it was previously. Batson said discussions about the \"evolution\" of the role began in Qatar, between him and Stewart.

And in their work with Sportsology, the consulting firm brought in to lead the sporting director search, \"we got validation through the review as to how other federations [around the world] are organized, as well as feedback from our team around what's working well, and where are some challenges,\" Batson said. \"So,\" he said, \"put all those things together, and that's what's led us to do this.\" He and Cone acknowledged that there will be overlap between the sporting director position and the new position — in the talent identification realm, for example. And of course, for now, both are extremely conceptual; both could continue to evolve. But the new delineation, Batson explained, is that the sporting director will be \"looking at player pools of thousands or low tens of thousands, [and] coaching pools of hundreds\" — the very top of the pyramid. \"As an organization, we also need to be thinking strategically around player pools of millions, coaching pools of hundreds of thousands, referee pools of hundreds of thousands\" — and that's what the person who fills the new position will do."

In the first months of this year, Amazon                              (AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft                              (MSFT) have all confirmed major job cuts impacting tens of thousands of tech workers.     Silicon Valley layoffs go from bad to worse         Shares of Meta rose more than 4% in early trading Tuesday following the announcement.            When the first round of job cuts was announced in November, Zuckerberg blamed himself at the time for the company’s over-hiring earlier in the pandemic. Meta  nearly doubled its headcount between March 2020 and September of last year, as the Covid-19 crisis led to a surge in demand for digital services.             But the situation changed radically for the social media giant and other tech companies as pandemic restrictions eased and people returned to their offline lives. Meta’s core business was also hit by privacy changes implemented by Apple                              (AAPL) and advertisers tightening budgets amid recession fears.             In his post on Tuesday announcing the latest cost-cutting efforts at Meta, Zuckerberg called the last year “a humbling wake-up call.”            “The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew, and our growth slowed considerably,” he wrote."

While many of these companies boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, some of the largest ones have reported financial results in recent weeks that showed they are feeling the fallout of global economic jitters. Last week, Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, laid off roughly half the company’s 7,500 employees, saying the social media service was losing $4 million a day. “These cycles of boom and bust are incredibly destructive within organizations because people employed there feel like they don’t know where they stand,” said Sandra J. Sucher, a management professor at Harvard. By rapidly hiring across all departments during the pandemic, Mr. Zuckerberg had set up his company to need reductions in staff, she said. Mr. Zuckerberg has been telegraphing that Meta will have to clamp down on costs, starting with cutting back on many of the lavish perks that employees once enjoyed. In March, he announced that the company was trimming or eliminating free services like laundry and dry cleaning. He also scaled back free dinner offerings, making it harder for employees to take home dinner for themselves and their families. In July, Mr. Zuckerberg warned employees that the company was experiencing “one of the worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history,” and in September he announced a hiring freeze. Last month, he warned that “teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year."

By Adam Satariano LONDON — In the latest penalty against Meta for violating European privacy rules, the tech giant was fined roughly $275 million on Monday for a data leak, discovered last year, that led to the personal information of more than 500 million Facebook users being published online. The penalty, imposed by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, brings the fines that the regulator has imposed on Meta since last year to more than $900 million. In September, the same regulator fined the company roughly $400 million for its mistreatment of children’s data. In October last year, Irish authorities fined Meta, which was previously called Facebook, 225 million euros, or about $235 million, for violations related to its messaging service WhatsApp. The accumulating penalties will be a welcome sign to privacy groups that want to see European Union regulators more aggressively enforce the General Data Protection Regulation. The law was hailed as a landmark moment in the regulation of technology companies when it took effect in 2018, but regulators have since faced criticism for not applying the rules strongly enough. Ireland has been under pressure because of the key role it plays in enforcing E.U. data protection rules. The country polices tech companies’ compliance with the 2018 law because companies such as Meta, Google and Twitter put their E.U. headquarters in Ireland."

By Natasha Singer Natasha Singer, a technology reporter at The New York Times, has covered children’s online privacy since 2012. TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, may face a fine of £27 million, or about $29 million, for failing to protect children’s privacy in the United Kingdom. In the first major case under new British rules protecting minors online, British regulators on Monday sent a warning notice to TikTok saying the company had handled youngsters’ information without appropriate permission from their parents, processed sensitive details without the legal grounds to do so and failed to explain the platform’s data practices in ways that children could easily understand. While the findings are provisional, the legal document sent to TikTok by Britain’s data protection agency, the Information Commissioner’s Office, constitutes a formal notification that regulators intend to impose a fine. It is not the first time that the video-sharing app has faced charges of failing to protect the privacy of younger users. In 2019, Musical.ly, the operators of the platform now known as TikTok, agreed to pay a fine of $5.7 million to settle federal charges that it had violated the federal children’s online privacy law in the United States.

The fine issued on Monday stems from an investigation started last year by Irish regulators into reports that Facebook had not safeguarded its platform against being “scraped” for information, leading to the publication on an online hacker forum of data that included users’ names, locations and birth dates, in violation of rules that require companies to safeguard personal information. Meta said in a statement that “unauthorized data scraping is unacceptable and against our rules.” The company said it had changed its policies to prevent such practices. Meta did not say whether it would appeal the decision, as it has for the Instagram and WhatsApp penalties. Meta is not the only tech giant facing scrutiny. Last year, Amazon was fined nearly €750 million over its online advertising practices by regulators in Luxembourg, where it has its European headquarters. In January, Google was fined €150 million by French regulators because users were not given an adequate way to decline so-called cookie trackers used by online advertisers to trace a person’s internet browsing history.

The stream constantly cuts from the Seinfeld apartment to Jerry Seinfeld’s stand-up segments, again, algorithmically generated jokes (and honestly, they’re not that far removed from Jerry Seinfeld’s limp one-liners). As an experiment in AI, it makes for an oddly fascinating watch, but the creators seem to have higher ambitions. Hartle went on to say: “As generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, you're gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want. You don't just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it. And so that became one of our grounding pillars.” After watching the stream, creatives can likely rest easy that AI isn’t coming for their jobs, yet. The AI is absolutely incapable of writing witticisms, but it is inadvertently hilarious, and sometimes, oddly terrifying."

Photo provided by Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS On March 2, Russia claims control of the southern city of Kherson. In the opening days of March, Russian forces also seize the rest of the Kherson region and occupy a large part of the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, including the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe’s largest. The Russian army soon gets stuck near Kyiv, and its convoys — stretching along highways leading to the Ukrainian capital — become easy prey for Ukrainian artillery and drones. On March 16, Russia strikes a theater in the strategic port city of Mariupol where civilians had been sheltering, killing hundreds of people in one of the war’s deadliest attacks. WATCH: Russian attacks expand in Ukraine, worsening civilian suffering Moscow announces the withdrawal of forces from Kyiv and other areas March 29, saying it will focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbas, where Russia-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces since 2014 following the illegal annexation of Crimea. People fleeing from Ukraine arrive in Hungary, after Russia launched a massive military operation against Ukraine, in Tiszabecs, Hungary, February 27, 2022."

These new features, added to the already robust Adobe Sensei AI and machine learning features you rely on every day, make Photoshop the world’s most advanced AI application for creatives. This smart use of technology enables you to work faster than ever before so you have way more time to be creative. Today we ship Neural Filters, Sky Replacement, the new Discover panel, and two new Refine Edge Selections improvements all built on artificial intelligence, in addition to many other great new features you will use every day. Neural Filters is a major breakthrough in AI-powered creativity and the beginning of a complete reimagination of filters and image manipulation inside Photoshop. This first version ships with a large set of new filters. Many of these filters are still in the beta quality state. We’ve decided to ship them to you now so you can try them out and give feedback and help shape the future of AI in Photoshop. Neural Filters is part of a new machine learning platform, which will evolve and get better over time – expanding on what’s possible exponentially. The new Sky Replacement feature intelligently separates the sky from the foreground and allows you to create the ultimate images with beautiful, dynamic skies in just a few clicks.         The Discover panel is loaded with tools and tips to help you work faster."

This is a great new tool inside Photoshop where we will continue to add AI capabilities that enhance your experience with the product. Object Aware Refine Edge and Refine Hair both use AI to further improve selections that include tricky subjects like hair or complex backgrounds. You already rely on artificial intelligence features in Photoshop to speed your work every day like Select Subject, Object Selection Tool, Content-Aware Fill, Curvature Pen Tool, many of the font features, and more. Our goal is to systematically replace time-intensive steps with smart, automated technology wherever possible. With the addition of these five major new breakthroughs, you can free yourself from the mundane, non-creative tasks and focus on what matters most – your creativity. Here’s everything we released in Photoshop today:         Sky Replacement Neural Filters is a new workspace inside Photoshop that introduces new non-destructive filters to help you explore creative ideas in seconds. In it we have taken many things Photoshop does well and improved them by reducing complex workflows to one click or a couple of sliders using machine learning. You can discover a rapidly growing and improving library of artistic and restorative filters, find a “best” idea for inspiration, and refine your image with the familiar tools you know in Photoshop. The filters in this workspace will speed parts of your workflow, but they might not produce the result you need every time."

Rebel Moon is clearly a big deal for Netflix, which is on the hunt for more homegrown franchises to line up alongside Stranger Things and The Witcher in the ongoing battle for streaming supremacy. Snyder himself told the Hollywood Reporter, \"my hope is that this also becomes a massive IP and a universe that can be built out.\" On top of the previously mentioned Rebel Moon sequel, Forbes say an RPG videogame may also be on the cards, while extended, R-rated versions of both confirmed Rebel Moon movies are seemingly on the way (via SlashFilm). Space opera designed exclusively for grown-ups? That's a surefire way to put some clear space between Rebel Moon and the veteran, family-friendly franchise that inspired it. Netflix isn't usually in the habit of showing off its wares half a year ahead of release, so it's still a little early for a full Rebel Moon trailer. Nonetheless, we have been treated to a tiny bit of footage courtesy of the streaming platform's 2023 preview.

Some women did not see this as a victory due to her political positions, while others saw it at least partly in a positive light, and a few others called her a feminist despite Meloni's rejection of the label.[241] Prior to the election, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented: \"The election of the first woman prime minister in a country always represents a break with the past, and that is certainly a good thing.\"[242][243] This prompted a response from some critics and observers, including historians Ruth Ben-Ghiat and David Broder. Ben-Ghiat wrote: \"Meloni would also represent continuity with Italy's darkest episode.\"[244] For her part, Meloni declared herself ready to govern and criticised feminists.[245]  Meloni has criticised Italy's approach towards illegal immigrants,[246] calling for a zero-tolerance policy, and she wants to blockade migrants from reaching Italian ports,[91] and boost the birth rate of Italian nationals to ease the need for migrant labour.[247] She is opposed to birthright citizenship proposals, which would give citizenship including education rights to immigrants born and living in Italy.[248] She has linked illegal immigration and crime, and refugee arrivals to human trafficking and prostitution."

As president of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party since 2020,[86] she said she shared the experiences and values of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, Likud in Israel, and the Republican Party in the United States.[87] Critics were sceptical of her claims, citing her speeches on immigration and LGBT rights.[88][89] She campaigned for lower taxes, less European bureaucracy, and a halt to immigration through a naval blockade,[90][91] saying she would put national interests first.[92][93][94]"

It was aimed at investing in young people and contained five initiatives, including incentives for new entrepreneurs, bonuses in favour of temporary workers and loans for deserving students.[34] In November 2012, she announced her bid to contest the PdL leadership against Angelino Alfano, in opposition to the party's support of the Monti government. After the cancellation of the primaries, she teamed up with fellow politicians Ignazio La Russa and Guido Crosetto to set out an anti-Monti policy, asking for renewal within the party and being also critical of the leadership of Berlusconi.[35][36]"

Meloni is hardly the first to relish political combat. But some Italians worry she’ll further polarize the country and loosen some of the restraints in society. Edith Bruck, a Holocaust survivor and poet who lives in Rome, and who has befriended Pope Francis, noted Meloni’s shorthand way for introducing herself: as a woman, a mother, an Italian and a Christian. “What is the implication of that?” Bruck said. “That she isn’t Muslim or Jewish? It all goes back to the idea that Europe is Christian and non-Christians are a threat.” Meloni’s allies see it differently. Giovanbattista Fazzolari, a Brothers of Italy senator who has known Meloni since she was a teenager, said Meloni would represent the whole country, but that there could be “exceedingly hard” clashes with entrenched powers that she judges aren’t working “for the good of the nation.” On the campaign trail, Meloni has dealt with mostly adoring crowds, plus the occasional protest group chanting “fascists” at her supporters. And she’s used even the off-script moments as evidence that she’s ready for the job."

Separately, McCarley was having similar conversations with McIlroy and his team. NBC launched GolfPass with McIlroy in 2019, two years before McCarley left the network. “It evolved into how we can harness technology to enhance the experience for both participants who play and for fans,” McCarley said. “We believe there is a difference between following and watching -- so shorter-form experiences are going to be more important as we continue to be crunched for time.” MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS: McCarley bounced the idea off his mentor, Ebersol, who immediately bought into the idea and helped McCarley refine the concept."

This week due to time constraints on my end, I will only be going in depth on the MTU-ASU game but will give a quick lightning rough on the BU-AF game and the possible match ups for day two.  FREE STREAM LINK: https://pac-12.com/arizona-state/schedule/network/live-stream/20221219-20230119  The last time these two teams faced off was also the last time ASU managed to make a NCAA tournament bid. Since then, the road for the Sun Devils has been rocky at best. This is their first season in their new hockey arena aptly named “Mullet Arena”. While they may share it with the Arizona Coyotes for the next few years, make no mistake, this is the Sun Devils arena first and the Coyotes second."

In the past, Derry Girls has landed on the global streaming platform after all episodes of Derry Girls have finished airing on Channel 4 and All4. This means Derry Girls could land in June 2022 at the earliest or at some point this summer. Fingers crossed it will not be too long a wait. Derry Girls will be sticking to its roots in the third and final Season 3, which means, yes, more drama and mischief from Erin, her cousin Orla and their friends Clare, Michelle, and English James as they come of age during the Troubles in Derry while juggling school at Our Lady Immaculate College., romance, relationships and the chaos of the 1990s. Season 3 will see the gang waiting for their exam results but, as teased in the trailer, fans can expect to see a lot of the usual mess the Derry Girls find themselves in. The official synopsis per Channel 4 teases: \"While Northern Ireland is growing up, this gang of eejits certainly aren't any time soon - there's hope in the air that The Troubles may finally be over, but their troubles are only just getting started as they get ever closer to 'adulthood'."

Rival Google followed with AI Bard in March. The waitlist to try Bard has now been removed, with the service publicly available as of this week.

The bot is called BlenderBot 3 and can be accessed on the web. (Though, right now, it seems only residents in the US can do so.) BlenderBot 3 is able to engage in general chitchat, says Meta, but also answer the sort of queries you might ask a digital assistant, “from talking about healthy food recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city.” BlenderBot 3 is designed to both shoot the breeze and answer questions like Google The bot is a prototype and built on Meta’s previous work with what are known as large language models or LLMS — powerful but flawed text-generation software of which OpenAI’s GPT-3 is the most widely known example. Like all LLMs, BlenderBot is initially trained on vast datasets of text, which it mines for statistical patterns in order to generate language. Such systems have proved to be extremely flexible and have been put to a range of uses, from generating code for programmers to helping authors write their next bestseller."

You can then narrow down the information in the snapshot with follow-up questions. These AI snapshots are powered by the updated version of Google’s large language model (LLM) called PaLM 2, something that Google also announced at I/O. The new model is already powering 25 Google services, including the company’s Bard chatbot, and comes with improvements in reasoning, coding, and translation. Speaking of Bard, Google has announced that its AI-powered chatbot is now available to everyone, regardless of whether you were on the waitlist. The company is also adding a host of new features, such as support for Japanese and Korean languages and an easier way to export generated text to Google Docs and Gmail. There are new dark mode and visual search features as well, and Google plans on adding even more functionality in the future.

The second-year Nebraska AD, originally from Eastern Iowa, traveled separately from the Huskers to attend the final game of the season. An introductory news conference in Lincoln for Rhule could come as early as Sunday. Nebraska officials, without direct instruction from Alberts on the timing, have reserved the Hawks Championship Center for use to stage a hiring event. Rhule’s personality will mesh with the state of Nebraska. He’s a New York native and thrived as a head coach in Pennsylvania and Texas. So he’s adaptable. Nebraskans will like his work ethic and the respect that he’s shown already for the Nebraska program, which has won or shared five national titles. He said Saturday on ESPN’s “College GameDay” that he grew up “revering” the Huskers. Rhule talked before the announcement with former coach Tom Osborne and praised the leadership at the university, including Joseph, the well-liked former Nebraska QB who coached the team for the final nine games this season after Frost was fired. — Sherman He’s big on building culture, a must for Nebraska — which has lacked an identity on offense for far too long. Rhule emphasizes physical play. His track record at Temple and Baylor backs it up. Nebraska talked a big game about physicality under Frost, but its play on the field belied that message."

Its first president was none other than the literary great Samuel Johnson, and over the years Columbia has produced numerous distinguished alumni, from Oscar winners and Nobel laureates to Supreme Court judges. Three US Presidents and the authors of the Declaration of Independence and American Constitution were also schooled at Columbia. It also runs the highly distinguished Pulitzer Prize, an annual award for achievements in journalism, literature and musical composition.  The university is organized into 20 schools, including undergraduate schools such as Columbia College, the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the School of General Studies, as well as graduate schools such as Columbia Law School, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia Journalism School and Columbia Business School. It also had global research outposts across the world. Its total student body numbers around 28,000 and is comprised mainly of postgraduates, with roughly 8,500 undergraduate students.  Columbia’s main campus is Morningside Heights, occupying around six city blocks in the Morningside Heights district of New York."

But one great part of using the text-to-speech for this copy is that the automated voice mispronounces “POV,” saying it instead as a word rather than an initialism. This provides a fun bit of comedic relief, and you’ll often see people use the text-to-speech feature to see how it pronounces various words, acronyms, and initialisms. Nike is one of the most well-known running shoe and athletic wear stores in the world, so it’s no surprise that they’ve put together a great presence on TikTok. They often share videos of professional athletes or clips from sports games. However, they also rope pro athletes in to film content for them as well. Here’s a great example of that below:  In this video, they did a mixture of text-to-speech narration and letting the people in the video talk. This is a great way to provide some context for the video while still letting those being recorded make the bigger impact. At Home is a home decor superstore that is easy to get lost inside. They share lots of videos of the products they’re selling in store as well as some humorous videos about throw pillows and other popular home decor items."

Smith provided a new recording of the part of \"Lullaby\"'s verses, greatly increasing their clarity compared with mix of the original Cure recording.  \"Lullaby\" was played live during Page & Plant's 1995 No Quarter Tour; the duo's backing band included Porl Thompson on guitar.

Tesla’s underwhelming quarter is the latest sign that growing macroeconomic uncertainty is having some impact on demand for its electric vehicles. The company’s operating margins took a big hit due to the negative impact of its price-slashing strategy. The EV maker faces several near-term headwinds, including persistently high inflation, a looming economic slowdown, as well as ongoing supply chain issues. Tesla’s worrying China sales figures indicate demand for its vehicles is slowing more than expected in the face of rising competition from local EV companies. The uncertain demand outlook puts it in danger of missing 50% growth in deliveries for the year.

The bot is called BlenderBot 3 and can be accessed on the web. (Though, right now, it seems only residents in the US can do so.) BlenderBot 3 is able to engage in general chitchat, says Meta, but also answer the sort of queries you might ask a digital assistant, “from talking about healthy food recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city.” BlenderBot 3 is designed to both shoot the breeze and answer questions like Google The bot is a prototype and built on Meta’s previous work with what are known as large language models or LLMS — powerful but flawed text-generation software of which OpenAI’s GPT-3 is the most widely known example. Like all LLMs, BlenderBot is initially trained on vast datasets of text, which it mines for statistical patterns in order to generate language. Such systems have proved to be extremely flexible and have been put to a range of uses, from generating code for programmers to helping authors write their next bestseller.",

It is likely its views on Mr Zuckerberg have been \"learnt' from other people's opinions that the algorithm has analysed.  The Wall Street Journal has reported BlenderBot 3 told one of its journalists that Donald Trump was, and will always be, the US president.  A business Insider journalist said the chatbot called Mr Zuckerberg \"creepy\".  Meta has made the BlenderBot 3 public, and risked bad publicity, for a reason. It needs data.  \"Allowing an AI system to interact with people in the real world leads to longer, more diverse conversations, as well as more varied feedback,\" Meta said in a blog post.  Chatbots that learn from interactions with people can learn from their good and bad behaviour. In 2016 Microsoft apologised after Twitter users taught its chatbot to be racist. Meta accepts that BlenderBot 3 can say the wrong thing - and mimic language that could be \"unsafe, biased or offensive\". The company said it had installed safeguards, however, the chatbot could still be rude. When I asked the BlenderBot 3 what it thought about me, it said it had never heard of me."

The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.",

The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix Stadium).[6]  Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV.  After the Eagles went into halftime up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but supported by others."

Countries that rose to the top of the podium at the first edition of the Winter Games in 1924 have traditionally stayed relevant to this day. Others had dominant periods before being merged or broken off into different countries all together. Between established European powers and two North American powerhouses, which nation has the highest medal count of all time?

However, the majority of the medals that the host country won during the 2022 Winter Olympics were gold, as the Chinese ranked third with nine gold medals at the Games. There were two Chinese athletes who won two golds: freestyle skier Eileen Gu and short-track speed skater Ren Ziwei. And not only did Gu win a pair of golds, but she was one of only 12 athletes at this year's Winter Games to capture three or more medals, as she also won a silver. Gu was the first freestyle skier to win three medals at a single Winter Games in Olympic history. Her golds came in the big air and halfpipe events, and they were the first won by the 18-year-old in her Olympic career.

The couple is worth 730 million pounds ($826 million), according to the Sunday Times Rich List. In April 2022, it emerged that Murty did not pay U.K. tax on her overseas income. The practice was legal — and Murty soon agreed to relinquish it — but it looked bad at a time when millions of Britons were struggling to make ends meet. Sunak’s victory is a remarkable reversal of fortune just weeks after he lost to Truss in a Conservative election to replace Johnson. Sunak was chosen as Conservative leader on Monday after becoming the only candidate to clear the nomination threshold of 100 lawmakers. Sunak defeated House of Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt — who keeps that job in his government — and Johnson, who failed to rally enough support for a comeback bid. Next Sunak has to prepare for a budget statement, scheduled to be delivered by Hunt on Oct. 31, that will set out how the government plans to come up with billions of pounds (dollars) to fill a fiscal hole created by soaring inflation and a sluggish economy — and exacerbated by Truss’ destabilizing plans. Truss announced her resignation last week and departed Tuesday after making a defiant public statement in Downing Street, seven weeks to the day after she was appointed prime minister."

GPT-1, the model that was introduced in June 2018, was the first iteration of the GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) series and consisted of 117 million parameters. This set the foundational architecture for ChatGPT as we know it today. GPT-1 demonstrated the power of unsupervised learning in language understanding tasks, using books as training data to predict the next word in a sentence. GPT-2, which was released in February 2019, represented a significant upgrade with 1.5 billion parameters. It showcased a dramatic improvement in text generation capabilities and produced coherent, multi-paragraph text. But due to its potential misuse, GPT-2 wasn't initially released to the public. The model was eventually launched in November 2019 after OpenAI conducted a staged rollout to study and mitigate potential risks. GPT-3 was a huge leap forward in June 2020.

The claim was dismissed “with prejudice” meaning it cannot be filed in court again. Athletics Director Kirby Hocutt terminated Stollings in 2020 after reports of hostile and inappropriate environments in the basketball program. MORE: Report alleges toxic environment, sexual harassment within Lady Raiders basketball program Stollings believes she was fired without cause in August 2020 and retained attorney Peter Ginsberg to pursue litigation against the school. The complaint alleged nine claims for relief, including breach of contract, defamation, fraud, and violations of Title IX protections. Part of Stollings’ complaint also alleges that the decision to terminate her was discriminatory, claiming she was penalized for identifying as LGTBQ, and employing “the same demanding and effective coaching techniques that male coaches at the school utilized, and continue to utilize, without consequence.” In March 2022, a federal judge once again threw out most of Marlene Stollings’ lawsuits against Texas Tech. The former Lady Raider basketball coach made new claims for damages late last year and refiled her original ones related to her firing in 2020."

Per USA Today's Josh Peters, the settlement came after Stollings and the university filed a joint motion to settle on Wednesday and a judge dismissed the case on Thursday. Stollings filed a lawsuit against the school and athletic director Kirby Hocutt in October 2020, two months after she was fired by the program. She said the firing was due to \"discriminatory biases against female coaches\" and also accused the school of fraudulent inducement, fraud, breach of contract and defamation. Texas Tech announced Stollings' firing on Aug. 6, 2020, one day after USA Today's Jori Epstein and Daniel Libit published a report with allegations of abuse and a toxic culture during her two seasons with the program. In the report, multiple Red Raiders players said Stollings and the coaching staff would call players \"disgusting,\" \"trash,\" \"fat pig,\" \"grossly out of shape\" and \"grossly disproportional.\" Three international players told Epstein and Libit they were targeted by coaches and ridiculed over their English language skills. One of the players, Marcella Lamark, who is from Brazil, said Stollings called her \"dangerous\" to teammates and gave her instructions to eat and train in isolation."

In Black Adam: The Dark Age, Adam (now under his civilian title of \"Teth-Adam\") gets into Khandaq under a false name, and takes her remains despite a shootout in which nearly all his men are killed. In the mountains, he is forced to eat his servant Hassan who offers himself to Black Adam. He fails to notice that he has dropped one of her fingers and her ring at the tomb. He resurrects Isis using the Lazarus Pit. Her resurrection is short lived, as Adam is forced to kill Isis again upon seeing her new body rotting away as soon as she has come back to life. Her bones are then transferred to Doctor Fate's tower, where, with the assistance of Felix Faust, Adam turns them into a magical conduit to imbue himself with god-like powers taken from Isis' corpse itself. Apparently, Isis still could be revived, but every time Adam takes power from her, her bones become more brittle, jeopardizing a new attempt at resurrection. Faust reveals that it is Isis' amulet that can revive her, and that Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. broke it into four parts and scattered it across the globe. It is later revealed that the missing fragments of her body, the reason the Lazarus Pit failed, were being held by Atom-Smasher who found it when the Justice Society investigated the tomb."

Although she said she can often come off as sarcastic and cynical, the emoji and punctuation Your Move used in its replies highlighted her playful side, which she said is usually more likely to come out in person. Taylor Margot, the founder of Keys AI, a tool built to help people communicate via text, said that a significant portion of Keys users employ it for dating-app conversations. He said he understands the skepticism that comes with new technology, especially when it is applied to something as personal as dating, but believes in the technology’s ability to foster deeper human connection. “It’s about teaching people to be more curious and empathetic,” he said. “It’s not about just giving people a snappy response or openers. I’m truly trying to change how people communicate and build meaningful relationships.” None of the users The Post spoke to reported disclosing their use of AI dating tools to their matches or dates. Margot said he thinks that will change soon. “It’s the early phase of the adoption curve of AI,” he said. “Remember when people didn’t want to share that they met on a dating app? That’s where we are now with people admitting they use AI to communicate better rather than doing it themselves."

Some of the aspects didn’t fit me, but it felt nice and conversational. Eventually, I asked for a more personalized version, and that one was a little bit better. I cut out the guitar strummer part because I don’t play guitar.” Your Move also recently rolled out a feature that helps generate the perfect dating app profile. Slate writer Heather Tal Murphy also turned to ChatGPT to land dates for a friend on the dating apps Tinder and Bumble. “ChatGPT encouraged an odd strain of forwardness that was helpful in getting the dates set up quickly,” Tal Murphy wrote. are you not impressed? because I am https://t.co/uWLchKL432 pic.twitter.com/7fHtYWEEDq Suman Kanuganti, the founder of Personal."

The subscription offering was launched in February and costs $20 per month for the upgraded features, including access to ChatGPT even during peak times. The company says the rollout of the new app will start in the U.S. today but it will expand to other countries in the “coming weeks.” An Android version is also teased as “coming soon.” Image Credits: OpenAI (App Store screenshot) Image Credits: OpenAI (App Store screenshot) OpenAI had been rumored to be working on a mobile client, according to a February article by Semafor, which the company had then declined to comment on. The ChatGPT app’s launch comes at a time when major tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, are experimenting with AI, and in the case of Google and Microsoft, also integrating AI capabilities into their search engines — the latter through an expensive partnership with OpenAI, in fact. But being able to access ChatGPT directly on mobile outside of a search engine or browser could potentially shake up how people today use their phones to search and connect with information. One thing that could be compelling about OpenAI’s mobile app versus search apps’ AI integrations is its ad-free nature."

Apple's App Store has previously hosted several apps that use OpenAI's software, but none were from OpenAI itself.  ChatGPT is the best-known example of a \"large language model,\" a type of machine learning application that trains on terabytes of data to be able to return output of long paragraphs or computer code that looks like a human wrote it.  The app is free, although it includes a $20 per month in-app purchase through Apple for ChatGPT Plus, OpenAI's subscription that offers additional features.

He said, “Gnawing at me for years were the untold sacrifices that my wife, Linda — we’ve been married 40 years — and my daughter Anil and my son Amar made. I will never know the sacrifices they made so that I could do what I did. The countless weeks away from them, the missing of so many precious moments in a child’s and a wife’s lifetime, experiences. And it began to gnaw at us more, more, more. And I decided it was time to walk off the field when I was approaching my 61st birthday.” In a statement to CNN, Shaw’s family requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Bernard Shaw Scholarship Fund at the University of Chicago.” Shaw is survived by his wife, Linda, and children, Anil and Amar. ©2022 Cox Media Group © 2023 Cox Media Group.

He was an insatiable adopter and adapter, an incomparable prestidigitator with the thoughts of the forerunners. Nietzsche, Samuel Butler (Erewhon), Marx, Shelley, Blake, Dickens, William Morris, Ruskin, Beethoven and Wagner all had their applications and misapplications. By bending to their service all the faculties of a powerful mind, by inextinguishable wit, and by every artifice of argument, he carried their thoughts as far as they would reach—so far beyond their sources that they came to us with the vitality of the newly created."

He was nursed by Charlotte Payne-Townshend, a rich Anglo-Irish woman whom he had met through the Webbs. The previous year she had proposed that she and Shaw should marry.[87] He had declined, but when she insisted on nursing him in a house in the country, Shaw, concerned that this might cause scandal, agreed to their marriage.[2] The ceremony took place on 1 June 1898, in the register office in Covent Garden.[88] The bride and bridegroom were both aged forty-one. In the view of the biographer and critic St John Ervine, \"their life together was entirely felicitous\".[2] There were no children of the marriage, which it is generally believed was never consummated; whether this was wholly at Charlotte's wish, as Shaw liked to suggest, is less widely credited.[89][90][91][92][93] In the early weeks of the marriage Shaw was much occupied writing his Marxist analysis of Wagner's Ring cycle, published as The Perfect Wagnerite late in 1898."

                "node_text": "Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt serve as writers and executive producers alongside fellow executive producers Martin Gero and Deborah Pratt, who narrated the opening of the original show, which ran on NBC for five seasons, between 1989 and 1993. The original series starred Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a physicist who created a time machine that allowed the user to travel through time within their own lifetime. After finding himself adrift in the Quantum Leap machine with no way home, Dr. Beckett resolved to put things right that once went wrong… hoping that his next leap would be the leap home. Quantum Leap joins several other series to be given a second chance, though it seems that for every terrific and twisted Twin Peaks-level continuation, there's a disappointing Heroes Reborn. The minds behind these projects continue to test the water with audience reaction to see what works and what doesn't — and such will be the case again here.

It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]  This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.  Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002."

Photo by Maggie Rotermund. Higgins did the weather reports for the 7 p.m. newscast on KPLR-TV Ch. 11 from a spot                near the Joseph G. Lipic Clock Tower on West Pine Mall. Higgins had three live segments                during the hour-long broadcast, plus a quick intro at the beginning of the show. During                the breaks, he and his camera person offered tips and tricks of the trade on live                broadcasting.  “It was amazing to see how Chris and Lou were able to work together when an obstacle                popped up,” said freshman Evelyn Maruszak.  Maruszak’s goal is a career in broadcast meteorology. “This broadcast course has been such a wonderful opportunity, and it is so special"

I had big shoes to fill after Mike Nelson, but St. Louis welcomed me with open arms. I forecasted through the floods of ’93 and ’95, which were tough times for the community. We also started the \"Clear the Air” campaign to lower pollutants and advise the city of poor air quality days. My favorite memories come from working with the people from Channel 4 and forecasting from St. Louis events like the VP Fair, the Muny, airshows and the Great Forest Park Balloon Race. One year, while recording the race, we landed in a horse pasture owned by Anheuser-Busch. They were kind to cut down the fence so we could get out. Another year, the balloon landed sideways, and we were dragged about 40 feet before coming to a stop. There was never a dull moment. Now • Since my time in St. Louis I mostly have stayed home to raise our three daughters. Emma, 24, lives in Chicago and works in advertising. She also is a wedding photographer. Our second daughter, Alyse, will graduate from nursing school this May and is ready to take on the pandemic. Mia is 17 and still at home. She has dreams of being an astrophysicist."

Quarterbacks have earned the honor 32 times in 57 games (and 58 awards).[12]  From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car from General Motors as a part of their MVP award.
