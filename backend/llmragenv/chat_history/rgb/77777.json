The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time.

{"id":76,"query":"What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?","answer":["48"],"type":"YELLOW","vector_response":"48MP","graph_response":"Not specified","hybrid_response":"48MP","vector_retrieval_result":["One of the biggest upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system is the main lens being increased to 48MP with what Apple calls an \u201cadvanced quad-pixel sensor.\u201d However, the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible \u2013 allowing for impressive crops and edits \u2013 using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that\u2019s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says \u201cwith a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.\u201d Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera \u2013 Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW.","iPhone 14 Pro models feature an upgraded rear camera system that can shoot 48-megapixel photos, but only in ProRAW mode. This article explains what ProRAW is and how to enable it. Apple's biggest camera upgrade for the \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c and \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c Max models is to the Main lens, which has been increased to 48 megapixels.  Apple says the new sensor also comes with a \"new machine learning model [that] delivers sharper images and less noise for unprecedented detail.\" However, this only applies when taking ProRAW shots at 48 megapixels. Otherwise, the camera defaults to shooting in 12-megapixel resolution, similar to iPhone 13 models.  There's a good reason for this. ProRAW is a 10-bit file that uses the Linear DNG format to retain more information and dynamic range, providing additional flexibility when editing exposure and white balance. With a ProRAW image containing 8,064 x 6,048 pixels, these files consume a significant amount of storage and can be approximately 75MB in size, or three times the size of an average 12-megapixel image.  Unless you have the largest capacity 1TB \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c model, you're unlikely to want to shoot at this resolution all the time.","I ended up with hundreds of photos and dozens of video clips on the 1TB iPhone 14 Pro review sample that Apple had lent me. The iPhone 14 Pro has three rear cameras: a main wide-angle camera, an ultrawide and a telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. The lens on the main camera has a wider focal length, going from a 26mm equivalent on previous iPhone models to a 24mm one. It isn't drastically different, but it helps get more of the scene into the frame.   Just a cat under mixed lighting, as captured by the iPhone 14 Pro. The main camera also gets a new,\u00a0larger, 48-megapixel sensor. Though more megapixels doesn't necessarily mean better photos, Apple divides the pixels into groups of four and combines the four in each group into one larger pixel. This technique is called pixel binning, and it's been used on Android phones for years. The results are brighter photos that have less image noise (and as a bonus, less noise-reduction blur).\u00a0Apple's new imagining pipeline, called the Photonic Engine, takes things further and helps improve color accuracy and protect details. Take a look below at a photo I shot of a streetcar just after sunset. Pay special attention to the texture of the pavement and the details in the leaves and building behind the streetcar.","This year's iPhone will likely be a bit more stratified than usual. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman claims that Apple's iPhone 14 Pro will get a massive camera update, with the phone's main (wide) sensor being bumped up to 48-megapixels. If accurate, this would be one of the biggest upgrades Apple has made to the iPhone, which has had a 12-megapixel main camera sensor since the release of iPhone 6s in 2015.  However, Gurman says only the Pro models will get the 48-megapixel camera, while the regular iPhone models will have a 12-megapixel main sensor. Also, for the first time, only the Pro models will get Apple's new A16 chip, while the regular variants will either have the A15 (the same chip that powers the iPhone 13) or some variant of it.  Apple typically adds several big upgrades in terms of camera hardware on its Pro models; in the last couple of iterations, the difference was that the Pro models came with an additional telephoto camera on the back. But the standard and the Pro iPhone typically had the same (or very similar) main, wide camera; if Gurman's report is accurate, this will no longer be the case.  There will be other changes to Apple's phone lineup.","This isn\u2019t just about the pixels but about what\u2019s in the pixels \u2014\u00a0a whole image inside your image. I think the 12 MP shooting default is a wise choice on Apple\u2019s part, but it does mean that the giant leap in image quality on iPhone 14 Pro remains mostly hidden unless you choose to use a third party app to shoot 48 MP JPG / HEIC images or shoot in ProRAW and edit your photos later. Perhaps this is the first iPhone that truly puts the \u2018Pro\u2019 in \u2018iPhone Pro\u2019. If you know, you know.  A larger sensor means better bokeh. It\u2019s simply a fact. The reason for this is that a larger image field can allow for a more pronounced depth of field effect. In my testing, I found that the iPhone 14 Pro produces pleasing, excellent natural bokeh on close-focus subjects: Unfortunately, you will see this nice natural background blur in fewer situations. The minimum focus distance of the main camera has changed to 20 cm or a little under eight inches \u2014 a few centimeter less than the iPhone 13 Pro and any preceding iPhone. In practice, this also means you see the camera switching to its ultra-wide, macro-capable camera much more often. More on that later. If you\u2019re an absolute nerd like me, you will notice that your main camera is capturing a wider image."],"graph_retrieval_result":["Iphone 14 pro <-Part_of- Telephoto camera -Has_specification-> 3x optical zoom","Iphone 14 pro <-Part_of- Ultrawide camera <-Has_feature- Iphone 14 pro","Iphone 14 pro <-Part_of- Telephoto camera <-Enhances- Photonic engine","Iphone 14 pro <-Part_of- Telephoto camera <-Has_feature- Iphone 14 pro","Iphone 14 pro <-Announced- Apple -Reported-> Q2 earnings","Iphone 14 pro <-Announced- Apple -Introduces-> New iphone 14 and iphone 14 plus","Iphone 14 pro <-Announced- Apple -Has-> 860 million current paid subscriptions","Iphone 14 pro <-Announced- Apple -Has-> 5,000 apple authorized service providers","Iphone 14 pro <-Announced- Apple -Has-> Similar content moderation policies as google","Iphone 14 pro <-Announced- Apple -Has_avoided-> Mass layoffs"],"vector_evaluation":{"strategy":"vector","metrics":{"retrieval_metrics":{"precision":0.0,"recall":0.0,"relevance":0.0},"generation_metrics":{"answer_correctness":0,"rougeL_score":0,"hallucinations_score":-1,"exact_match":true}}},"graph_evaluation":{"strategy":"vector","metrics":{"retrieval_metrics":{"precision":0.0,"recall":1.0,"relevance":0.0},"generation_metrics":{"answer_correctness":0,"rougeL_score":0,"hallucinations_score":-1,"exact_match":false}}},"hybrid_evaluation":{"strategy":"vector","metrics":{"retrieval_metrics":{"precision":0.0,"recall":0.0,"relevance":0.0},"generation_metrics":{"answer_correctness":0,"rougeL_score":0,"hallucinations_score":-1,"exact_match":true}}},"avg_vector_evaluation":{"retrieval_metrics":{"precision":0.5681274471089945,"recall":0.75,"relevance":0.15},"generation_metrics":{"answer_correctness":0.0,"rougeL_score":0.0,"hallucinations_score":-1.0,"exact_match":0.5}},"avg_graph_evaluation":{"retrieval_metrics":{"precision":0.0,"recall":1.0,"relevance":0.0},"generation_metrics":{"answer_correctness":0.0,"rougeL_score":0.0,"hallucinations_score":-1.0,"exact_match":0.16666666666666666}},"avg_hybrid_evaluation":{"retrieval_metrics":{"precision":0.5681274471089945,"recall":0.75,"relevance":0.049999999999999996},"generation_metrics":{"answer_correctness":0.0,"rougeL_score":0.0,"hallucinations_score":-1.0,"exact_match":0.5}},"v_error":"true","g_error":"Hop Limitation","h_error":"true"}
