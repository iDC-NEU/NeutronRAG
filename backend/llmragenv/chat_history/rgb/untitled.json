The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. \u201cIt weighs on you every time, every day of the week,\u201d Busch said at NASCAR\u2019s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.","Sep 10, 2022 ...
